Overview
This sector includes both the wholesale and retail sale (i.e. sale without alteration) of
any type of goods. Wholesaling and retailing are the final steps in the distribution of
goods. Also included is the repair of motor vehicles and motorcycles.
Wholesale is the resale (sale without alteration) of new and used goods to retailers,
business-to-business trade, resale to other wholesalers, etc. Examples of wholesale
trade includes
• Non specialized wholesale trade
• Wholesale on a fee or contract basis
• Wholesale of agricultural raw materials and live animals
• Wholesale of food, beverages and tobacco
• Wholesale of household goods
• Wholesale of machinery, equipment and supplies
• Other specialized wholesale
A wholesaler will often assemble, sort and grade goods in large lots, and repack and
redistribute in smaller lots. The goods are frequently destined for retailers.
Retailers
Retailing is the resale (sale without alteration) of new and used goods – often referred
to as consumer goods - mainly to the general public for personal or household
consumption via shops, department stores, stalls, mail-order houses, door-to-door
sales persons, etc.
Retailers consist of small and large for-profit businesses that sell products directly to
consumers. To realize a profit, retailers search for products that coincide with their
business objectives and find suppliers with the most competitive pricing. Generally,
a retailer can buy small quantities of an item from a distributor or a wholesaler. For
instance, a retail trader who wanted to purchase 24 boxes of books could contact
stationery distributors to inquire about pricing.
The whole sale and retail sector faces a number of challenges and these includes:-
• Illiteracy of the players
• Numerous small segmented players.
• Poor records keeping.
• The sector is highly dominated by middle men who swindle traders’ money.
N.B
All players in this sector are required to account for their incomes and register for the
applicable tax types.
Any expense that exceeds 5 million in regard to an unregistered supplier is not tax
deductible. The players in this sector should therefore endeavor to register for TINs
and also transact with businesses that are registered too.

WHAT TAXES ARE APPLICABLE TO THE WHOLE SALE AND RETAIL SECTOR?
I. Income Tax.
This is tax imposed on a trader’s taxable income at specific rates and is charged on
every person who has chargeable income for each year of income. (Section 4 of the
Income Tax Act). This may be categorized into:
a) Presumptive tax for small tax payers.
A simplified process called Income Tax Presumptive (Small business) declaration was
designed to enable registration of payments and filing of returns for taxpayers under
this category.
 The Assessment year is a period of 12 months for the current or next period and shall
be in line with the registered accounting date.
This is imposed on small taxpayers (both individuals and non-individuals) whose
annual turnover is below UGX 150 million.
The presumptive tax rates are based on turnover, however there is a standard of
record keeping. Small businesses with no records will pay tax on a fixed basis whereas
those with records will pay tax as a percentage of turnover.

{
  "Gross Turnover Per Annum": {
    "With Records": {
      "Not exceeding UGX 10 million": "NIL",
      "Exceeding UGX 10 million but does not exceed UGX 30 million": "0.4% of annual turnover in excess of 10 million UGX 80,000",
      "Exceeding UGX 30 million but does not exceed UGX 50 million": "UGX 80,000 plus 0.5% of annual turnover in excess of UGX 30 million UGX 200,000",
      "Exceeding UGX 50 million but does not exceed UGX 80 million": "UGX 180,000 plus 0.6% of annual turnover in excess of UGX 50 million UGX 400,000",
      "Exceeding UGX 80 million but does not exceed UGX 150 million": "UGX 360,000 plus 0.7% of annual turnover in excess of UGX 80 million UGX 900,000"
    },
    "Without Records": {
      "Not exceeding UGX 10 million": "NIL",
      "Exceeding UGX 10 million but does not exceed UGX 30 million": "UGX 80,000",
      "Exceeding UGX 30 million but does not exceed UGX 50 million": "UGX 200,000",
      "Exceeding UGX 50 million but does not exceed UGX 80 million": "UGX 400,000",

Illustration
1. Kamonde is a resident employed by ABC Enterprises. He earns a monthly salary
of UGX 200,000. Is the company obliged to deduct PAYE tax from Kamonde?
Aguide To Taxation Of The Wholesale And Retail Sector 15
Solution; No, because Kamonde’s monthly salary is less than the threshold UGX
235,000 so his salary does not attract PAYE.
2. If Kamonde in addition to the monthly salary of UGX 200,000 is given travelling
monthly allowance of UGX 95,000 and medical monthly allowance of UGX
55,000. Monthly allowance for accommodation UGX 150,000
Compute his monthly amount of PAYE to be deducted from Kamonde’?
Solution;
Computation of Monthly Employment Income:
 UGX
Salary 200,000
Travelling allowance 95,000
Medical allowance 55,000
Accommodation allowance 150,000
Total {chargeable income} 500,000
Computation of the PAYE to be deducted:
{UGX 500,000 falls under the bracket (Exceeding UGX 410,000 but not exceeding
UGX 10,000,000)} Thus the PAYE applicable will be (30% of the amount by which
chargeable income exceeds UGX 410,000) + UGX 25,000
Chargeable Income 500000
Less 410000
Balance 90,000
30 % 27,000
Add 25,000
Tax there on in Shs. 53,000.

NOTE. For more information on how to calculate the employee benefits, please refer
to the income tax act section 19 and the fifth schedule
Local service tax paid to KCCA and local government is exempted from PAYE.

e) Withholding Tax (WHT)
This is a tax withheld at source at the point of making a payment to the supplier/
service provider. Total payments to a supplier in respect of a supply of goods or
services as provided for in a transaction amounting to one million shillings and above
in aggregate attracts WHT of 6% to residents and 15% to non-residents under Section
119 of the Income tax Act.
Note that the amount withheld on any payment is part of your annual tax payment
and thus reduces on
16 Aguide To Taxation Of The Wholesale And Retail Sector
Your annual tax liability.
Responsibility of Filing a WHT return and Payment of WHT
• The responsibility for payment of the tax rests primarily on the person making
payment as a withholding agent. Thus, in case of his/her failure to withhold the
tax or in case of under-withholding, the under-collected tax becomes due from
the withholding agent.
• A WHT Agent is required to pay the tax withheld within 15 days after the end
of the month in which the payment subject to withholding tax was made by
the WHT Agent. . Note; this is not only for PAYE but also all other Withholding
taxes.
Illustration
If Muban and Sons a sole proprietorship supplies Capital Shoppers (Designated
Withholding Agent) with taxable supplies worth 100 Million UGX, then he will receive
a net of 94 million UGX and the 6 million UGX (6% of 100Million) will be Withheld and
remitted to URA by Capital shoppers on his behalf.

II. Value Added Tax (VAT)
It is a tax on consumption charged on value added to “taxable” goods and services
(Standard Rated Supplies), at different stages in the chain of distribution and
is charged at a rate of 18% on all supplies made by taxable persons i.e. persons
registered or required to register for VAT purposes. The threshold for VAT registration
is an annual turnover of 150 million UGX and above or turnover of 37.5 million UGX in
any 3 consecutive months.
Some transactions are beyond the scope of VAT and these are classified as Exempt
Supplies (Second Schedule of the VATA). Supplies on which VAT is charged at 0% are
classified as Zero Rated Supplies (Third Schedule of the VAT Act).
If a trader is registered for VAT, he can claim for his Input tax when selling a zero rated
product/service.

Note
• Traders dealing in taxable supplies with a gross turnover 150 million UGX and
above are required to register for VAT.
• Traders dealing in exempt supplies are not subject to Value Added Tax (VAT)
and so suffer VAT as a cost but must register for Income tax. However, traders
who deal in taxable supplies with a gross turnover below 150 million UGX can
voluntarily register for VAT if they meet the registration criteria.
• All taxpayers registered for VAT are required to file VAT returns for each month
by the 15th day of the following month.
Voluntary Registration
The Commissioner General shall register a person who applies for registration and
Aguide To Taxation Of The Wholesale And Retail Sector 17
issue to that person a certificate of registration including the VAT registration number
(TIN) unless the Commissioner General is satisfied that;
(a) the person has a fixed place of abode or business; or
(b) the Commissioner General has reasonable grounds to believe that that
person :–
• will keep proper accounting records relating to any business activity carried
on by that person;
• will submit regular and reliable tax returns as required by Section 31; or
• is a fit and proper person to be registered
Some transactions are beyond the scope of VAT and these are classified as Exempt
supplies. Supplies on which VAT is charged at 0% are classified as zero-rated supplies.


IMPORTANT:
ISSUANCE OF E-INVOICES OR E-RECEIPTS BY ALL VAT REGISTERED
TAXPAYERS
It is mandatory for all VAT registered taxpayers to issue e-invoices or e-receipts as
no tax credit is allowed or claimable on purchases unless they are supported by
e-invoices or e-receipts.
All VAT registered taxpayers are obliged to register for EFRIS and issue fiscalised
invoices i.e. e-invoices.
The Electronic Fiscal Receipting and Invoicing Solution (EFRIS) is a new smart
business solution used to record business transactions and share the information with
URA in real time.
An e-invoice shows that a sale has occurred through EFRIS. It shows the seller’s
details, URA information, Buyer’s details, Good and services details, Tax details and
Summary sections.

Penalties for non-compliance in regard to EFRIS
A VAT registered taxpayer who does not adopt the use of EFRIS is liable to pay a
penal tax equivalent to the tax due on the goods or services or 400 currency points
whichever is higher.
Note: One currency point =20,000 Uganda Shs.

PERIOD FOR CLAIMING INPUT TAX
The law allows a period of six (6) months from the date of issue of the invoice within
which a person can apply for an input tax credit.
Illustration
Gadhafi is an importer of children’s shoes. In June 2019 he imported 50 cartons of
shoes at UGX 5,000,000 for the entire consignment. He sold to a wholesaler at UGX
7,200,000. The wholesaler sold to a retailer at cost plus mark-up of 20%. The retailer
sold to the consumers at a mark-up of 10%.

NOTE: The mechanism of VAT is such that, for goods that are imported and
consumed in a particular state, the first seller (importer) pays the first point tax, and
the next seller pays tax only on the value-added – leading to a total tax burden exactly
equal to the last point tax.


III. LOCAL EXCISE DUTY
This is a tax that is imposed on specified imported or locally manufactured goods,
and services. Initially Excise Duty was meant for “luxury” or prohibited items. However
excise duty is now treated as any other source of revenue for Government. The
applicable rates may be specific or ad valorem.
The tax is imposed on the value of the import; and in the case of locally manufactured
goods, the duty (local excise duty) is payable on the ex-factory price of the
manufactured goods. Exported but locally manufactured goods are exempt from
excise duty.
Persons supplying excisable goods and services are required to register and file
monthly returns to the tax authority by the 15th day of the month following the month
in which delivery of the goods was made.
Note
Excise duty is charged on deliveries (Goods and services) made out of the factory as
well as on payment regardless of whether payment is made or not.
Excise duty return is submitted on a monthly basis and the due date for both filing
the return and payment is the 15th day of the subsequent month. Computation of
Aguide To Taxation Of The Wholesale And Retail Sector 19
excisable duty payable
EXCISE DUTY PAYABLE = (EX-FACTORY PRICE X QUANTITY) X EXCISE DUTY
RATE
However, Ex-factory price is defined as;
{
  "Items": [
    {
      "Item": "Cost of materials",
      "Amount": "XXXX"
    },
    {
      "Item": "Other related costs (overheads)",
      "Amount": "X"
    },
    {
      "Item": "Total Cost",
      "Amount": "XXXX"
    },
    {
      "Item": "Profit",
      "Amount": "XXXX"
    },
    {
      "Item": "Ex-Factory Price",
      "Amount": "XXXXX"
    }
  ]
}

Solution
EXCISE DUTY = (EX-FACTORY PRICE X QUANTITY) X EXCISE DUTY RATE
= (400X20,000UGX) X 10%
= 800,000 UGX
IV. Customs duties
These are taxes which are charged on all goods entering into or leaving our country.
The taxes charged depend on the Value and nature of the item imported.
Below are the Steps we follow when Computing Customs Duties.
• Step 1 Determine Customs Value (CV);
• Step 2 Convert the Customs Value to Local Currency (Shs.);
• Step 3 Classify the item (HSC) as per the common external tariff;
• Step 4 Determine taxes collectable
• Step 5 Apply the duty rates on the Customs Value

Customs duties comprise of.
a) Import duty (ID)
This is a tax collected on imports and some exports not listed in the exemption
schedule by URA. It is based on the customs value of the goods that are imported.
The customs value is Cost, Freight and Insurance up to Mombasa or cost and
insurance if by Air. The rate of import duty is either 0%, 10%, 25% or more for sensitive
items like wheat and powdered milk.
NB. For more information on import duty rates, please refer to our common external
tariff book on the portal under tax assistant, A-Z tax topics.

Formulae for calculating import duty
• Import Duty (ID) = ID rate x Customs value
• VAT = VAT value x 18%= (ID+EXD+CV) x 18%
b) Excise duty(EXD) at Importation
This tax is only charged on specific goods imported at varying rates.
Formulae for calculating excise duty
• Excise duty (EXD)= EXD value x EXD rate= (ID + Customs value ) x EXD rate
c) VAT at importation.
This is a tax on consumption charged on taxable goods imported into the country and
is charged at a rate of 18% if the importer is registered for VAT and at 15% on the 18%
of the value if the importer is not registered for VAT but importing taxable goods of a
value of shillings 4,000,000 and above.
NB. If the importer is registered for VAT, he/she can claim any VAT incurred at
importation through her/his monthly VAT returns.
Formulae for calculating VAT at importation
• VAT = VAT value x 18%= (ID+EXD+CV) x 18%
• Domestic VAT = 15% (VAT value x 18%) = 15% ((ID+EXD+CV) x 18%)
d) WHT at importation
This is income tax withheld at importation of a good. It is at a rate of 6% of customs
value. It can be claimed by the importer when he/she is filing his/her final income tax
return as advanced tax already paid.
NB. If the importer is exempted from WHT, he/she should not be charged this tax at
importation Formulae for calculating WHT at importation
• WHT = Customs value x 6%
e) Infrastructural levy
This levy is only applicable to dutiable items imported from outside EAC Region.
NB: The following will not attract the 1.5% Infrastructure Levy
1. Items that are at 0% Import duty rate
2. All items imported under conditional Exemptions as indicated in the 5th Schedule
of the EACCMA (East African Community Customs Management Act)
Aguide To Taxation Of The Wholesale And Retail Sector 21
Formulae for calculating infrastructural levy
• WT = Customs value x 1.5%
f) Environmental levy
This is tax levied on imports that may be harmful to the environment for example on
used clothes and used vehicle.
Formulae for calculating Environmental levy
• EL on used clothes = Customs value x 10%
• EL on used vehicles of YOM between 5 and 10 years = Customs value x 35%
• EL on used vehicles of YOM 10years and above = Customs value x 50%


WHAT ARE THE TAX POINTS APPLICABLE TO PLAYERS IN THE SECTOR?
i. The suppliers of stock: These are expected to have the following;
o Valid TINs that are clearly shown on invoices issued to their clients every time they
supply.
o File income tax returns or the simplified returns under Part 1 of the second

URA and issue the PAYEE a Withholding Tax Credit Certificate. The payees
could be transporters, cleaning firms, land lords/ladies or any other vendors.
Take note that separate supplies of goods or materials or supplies amounting
to above 1 million may attract the 6% WHT.
o International payments: this is applicable where a trader makes foreign
payments for management fees, or makes payments to a non-resident
contractor or professional under sections 83 and 85 of the Income Tax Act

**Advance Return and Instances**
Key return issues encompass various aspects of tax return filing, including Advance Return and the extension of Return Filing date. An Advance Income Tax return is submitted by a taxpayer before the end of a given year of Income. Instances requiring an advance return include situations where it's due before the end of the period, or in cases such as the taxpayer's death, bankruptcy, liquidation, permanent departure from Uganda, or other reasons deemed appropriate by the Commissioner. Failure to furnish an Advance Return by the due date results in the issuance of an Advance Assessment. The notice requesting such a return must be in writing, specifying the due date.
**Extension of Return Filing Date**
If a person is not able to file a return by the due date, they can apply for an extension, provided valid reasons justify the extension. However, the granted extension cannot exceed 90 days and does not alter the due date for tax payment, resulting in accrued interest on any outstanding tax liability. Multiple extensions can be requested as long as the total extension period does not exceed 90 days. Taxpayers dissatisfied with the Commissioner’s decision regarding the extension may challenge it through the objection and appeals procedure.
**Offences and Penalties on Returns**
Failure to furnish a return by the due date or within the extended time allowed by the Commissioner incurs penalties. The penalty for understating provisional tax estimates by more than 10% of the actual chargeable income is 20% of the difference in tax. Additionally, providing false statements knowingly or recklessly may result in a fine not exceeding Shs. 110,000,000 or imprisonment for up to ten years or both upon conviction.
**Consequences of Not Filing Return**
If a taxpayer fails to file their return, they will receive an assessment from the URA officer.

**Tax Assessments Overview**
Tax assessments are vital documents showing the estimated taxable income of an individual and the corresponding tax payable, including any penalties incurred.
**Default Assessment**
A default assessment is issued by the Commissioner to a taxpayer based on estimated taxable income when the taxpayer fails to furnish a self-assessment return for any given tax period.
**Advance Assessment**
An advance assessment is issued by the Commissioner if there is a risk that a taxpayer may delay, obstruct, prevent, or render ineffective tax payment or collection. It can be issued even before the taxpayer’s tax return for the period is due, particularly when the taxpayer defaults in submitting an advance return.
**Return Amendment**
Return amendment involves altering an original tax assessment to ensure the correct tax liability is established. Amendments can be made if fraud or gross neglect is discovered or if new information regarding tax liability surfaces.
**Payment of Tax and Subsequent Steps**
After filing the return, the taxpayer needs to register a payment and then proceed with the payment process. The payment should be made by the due date of filing the return.
**Registration of Payment**
To register a tax payment, taxpayers can visit the URA web portal and follow the instructions under the e-services section. They need to select the appropriate tax head, input the tax amount, provide taxpayer details, select the mode of payment, and complete the registration process.
**Modes of Tax Payment**
Tax payments can be made using various modes such as VISA, MasterCard, American Express, Union Pay, Mobile Money, EFT, RTGS, Swift, Cash, Cheque, Demand draft, or Point of Sale.
**Consequences of Non-Payment**
Failure to pay tax on time incurs interest at a rate of 2% per month on the outstanding amount. The Commissioner may collect any unpaid tax by serving a notice of demand on the person liable.
**Extension of Payment**
Taxpayers can request an extension to pay tax at a later date by submitting a written application to the Commissioner. However, interest will accrue from the original due date of payment despite any extension granted.

**Taxpayer's Recourse: Objections and Appeals**
**Option for Dissatisfied Taxpayers**
Taxpayers who are dissatisfied with their tax assessments have the right to object to the decision made against them.
**Understanding Objections**
An objection serves as a formal communication from a taxpayer to the Commissioner expressing dissatisfaction with an assessment or any other tax decision. This objection must follow the prescribed format determined by the Commissioner.
**Timelines for Objections**
Taxpayers have 45 days after receiving notice of a tax decision to lodge an objection with the Commissioner. They may also apply for an extension of time to lodge an objection, subject to the Commissioner's decision. The Commissioner must respond to the objection within 90 days of its receipt. Failure to respond within this timeframe allows the taxpayer to consider the objection as having been allowed.
**Options for Further Appeal**
If dissatisfied with the Commissioner's objection decision, taxpayers have two main avenues for further appeal:
a) They can apply for alternative dispute resolution procedures with the Commissioner.
b) They can lodge an application with the Tax Appeals Tribunal (TAT) for a review of the objection decision.
**Further Legal Recourse**
If still dissatisfied with the decision of the Tribunal, taxpayers can appeal to the High Court within 30 days of receiving notice of the decision. Subsequently, an appeal to the Court of Appeal can be made within 30 days of receiving notice of the High Court's decision. Appeals to the Supreme Court may be pursued on matters of great public importance or when the Court of Appeal deems it necessary for the interests of justice.
**Enforcement of Tax Recovery**
When taxpayers fail to comply with tax payment requirements, the Commissioner may enforce tax recovery through various means, including distress sales, agency notices, temporary closure of business premises, and seizure of goods. Additionally, taxpayers may be required to provide security for potential tax liabilities.
**Investigative Powers**
The Commissioner holds broad investigative powers, including access to premises, records, and information relevant to tax obligations. Taxpayers may be compelled to furnish information or attend examinations concerning their tax affairs, with penalties for non-compliance.


**Tax Clearance Certificate: Who Needs It?**
Certain taxpayers are required to obtain a tax clearance certificate for specific activities:
- Providers of passenger or freight transport services with vehicles of a capacity of two tonnes or more.
- Providers of warehousing or clearing and forwarding services.
- Taxpayers supplying goods or services to the Government.

**Other Potential Offences**
Various offences related to tax compliance may be committed, including:
- Failure to submit returns or documents.
- Non-compliance with agency notices or receiver requirements.
- Inadequate record-keeping.
- Failure to provide information without reasonable cause.
- Misuse of a taxpayer identification number.
- Making false or misleading statements.
- Obstruction of officers.
- Aiding or abetting others in committing offences.
- Offering bribes to officers.
