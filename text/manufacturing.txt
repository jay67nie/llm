AN OVERVIEW
Manufacturing is a process of physically or chemically transforming raw materials,
substances, or components into new products. The raw materials, substances, or
components transformed are products of agriculture, forestry, fishing, mining or
quarrying as well as products of other manufacturing activities.

IT INVOLVES;
According to the International Standard Industrial Classification of all Economic
Activities (ISIC), manufacturing involves substantial alteration (fabrications, welding,
moldings, mixing), renovation or reconstruction of goods using power-driven
machines and materials-handling equipment. It also includes transformation of
materials or substances into new products by hand, or heavy machinery at factories or
in the worker’s home, etc.

MANUFACTURING SECTOR IS DIVIDED INTO TWO UNITS
1) Units that directly process materials or
2) Units that contract with other units to process their materials for them.
The output of a manufacturing process may be a finished product in the sense that
it is ready for utilization or consumption e.g. ready beer, cement, clothes and sugar
among others
It may be semi-finished products (Intermediate), i.e. products used as inputs for
further manufacturing e.g. sugar used as a raw material for manufacturing of beer,
spirits; milk used for processing cheese, ice-cream, primary ALUMINIUM is an input
to ALUMINIUM wires, while ALUMINIUM wire is an input for the manufacture of
fabricated wire products.

SHOULD I PAY TAX AS A MANUFACTURER?
Yes. In Uganda, individuals and companies in the manufacturing business are required
to register and pay their fair share of tax from the income earned.
Please note:
All players in the manufacturing sector are required to register for the relevant tax
types and account for the applicable incomes. Under section 22(2)(m), of the Income
Tax Act, no expenditure will be allowed for any expense that exceeds 5 million in one
transaction in regard to supplies (goods or services) from an unregistered supplier.
The players in this sector should, therefore, endeavor to register for a TIN and also
transact with businesses that are registered.

HOW DO I REGISTER MY MANUFACTURING BUSINESS?
All manufacturers in Uganda are required to be registered with;
• Uganda Registration Services Bureau (URSB) for business name or company
registration
• Uganda Revenue Authority (URA) for taxes
• Local council authority e.g. KCCA, municipal council, for a trading license
Please note:
Upon registration, the manufacturer is required to comply with the requirements
of statutory bodies like the Uganda National Bureau of Standards (UNBS), Uganda
Investment Authority (UIA) and National Environment Management Authority
(NEMA).

WHAT DO I NEED TO REGISTER FOR TAXES (TIN REGISTRATION)?
TIN stands for Tax Identification Number. It is a 10-digit number which acts as an
account of a taxpayer with Uganda Revenue Authority (URA). All taxpayers are
required to quote this number in all their communications with URA and business
transactions.

Please note: A TIN is obtained free of charge and therefore no one should charge you
for it.

PAY AS YOU EARN (PAYE)
This tax applies to a sector player who has employees (administrative or
causal laborers) that earn an aggregate in excess of 235,000 per month.
This form of tax is withheld every month from the employee’s salary by the
employers and then remitted to URA on behalf of the employees.
Please Note:
1. It is an obligation of the employer (not the employee) to deduct PAYE on
a monthly basis and furnish the return by the 15th of the following month.
2. The amounts withheld should also be paid over to URA by the 15th of the
following month to avoid interest charges.

PAYE worked examples for resident employee.
1. Kamonde is a resident employed by ABC manufacturing ltd. He earns a
monthly salary of UGX 200,000. Is the company obliged to deduct PAYE tax from
Kamonde?
Solution; No, because Kamonde’s monthly salary is less than the threshold UGX
235,000 so his salary does not attract PAYE.
2. If Kamonde in addition to the monthly salary of UGX 200,000 is given
travelling monthly allowance of UGX 95,000 and medical monthly allowance of UGX
55,000. Monthly allowance for accommodation UGX 150,000 Compute his monthly
amount of PAYE to be deducted from Kamonde’?
13 A GUIDE TO TAXATION OF THE MANUFACTURING SECTOR
Solution;
Computation of Monthly Employment Income:
Salary 200,000 UGX
Travelling allowance 95,000 UGX
Medical allowance 55,000 UGX
Accommodation allowance 150,000 UGX
Total {chargeable income} 500,000 UGX
Computation of the PAYE to be deducted:
{500,000 falls under the bracket (Exceeding Shs 410,000 but not exceeding
10,000,000)}
Thus the PAYE applicable will be (30% of the amount by which chargeable income
exceeds Shs 410,000 + 25000
Chargeable Income 500.000 UGX
Less 410.000 UGX
Balance 90,000 UGX
30 % 27,000 UGX
Add 25,000 UGX
Tax there on in UGX 52,000
PAYE worked examples for non-resident employee.
3. Mr. Brown is a non-resident employed by ABC manufacturing ltd. He earns
a monthly salary of UGX15, 000,000= Compute his monthly amount of PAYE to be
deducted?
Solution
15,000,000 falls under the bracket (Exceeding UGX 410,000)
Thus PAYE = (30% (15,000,000 - 410,000) + 48,500) + 10% (15,000,000 -
10,000,000) = UGX 4,925,500


Withholding Tax (WHT)
Withholding tax (WHT) is a form of advance income tax that is withheld at source by
one person (withholding agent) upon making payment to another person (payee).
If a person supplies goods above one million Uganda shillings, the person to whom
those goods are supplied charges withholding tax at a rate of 6%.
The threshold of Shs. 1,000,000 is in respect of the total contract value, implying that
separate supplies which constitute one contract are subject to the 6% withholding tax
regardless of the fact that the amount paid per a single supply or transaction is less
than the threshold value.
The supplier receives a Tax Credit Certificate that helps in offsetting tax liability in the
final income tax return.

Who is a Withholding Agent?
A withholding agent is a person legally obliged to withhold tax on payment. To
become a withholding agent one must;
• Be on the list of selected / designated withholding agents published by the
Minister of finance in a gazette or
• Be making a payment on a transaction that is required by law to be deducted
from WHT.

Illustration
If Kato a resident individual supplies factory sundries worth 100 million UGX to ABC
manufacturing, he will receive a net of 94 million UGX and the 6 million UGX (6% of
100 million UGX) will be Withheld and remitted to URA by ABC ltd on his behalf. Note
that the 6million UGX withheld forms part of Kato’s annual Tax liability and thus will
reduce his Tax liability for the year.
Responsibility of Filing a WHT return and Payment of WHT
• The responsibility for payment of the tax rests primarily on the person making
payment as a withholding agent. Thus, in case of his/her failure to withhold the
tax or in case of under-withholding, the under-collected tax becomes due from
the withholding agent.
• A WHT Agent is required to pay the tax withheld within 15 days after the end of
the month in which the payment subject to withholding tax was made by the
WHT Agent. . Note; this is not only for PAYE but also all other Withholding taxes.


Value Added Tax (VAT)
This is an indirect tax on consumption charged on value added to taxable supplies, at
different stages in the chain of distribution at the rate of 18%.
Some transactions are beyond the scope of VAT and these are classified as exempt
supplies and are specified in the Second Schedule of the VAT Act Cap 349. Supplies
on which VAT is charged at 0% are classified as zero-rated supplies and are specified
in the Third Schedule of the VAT Act Cap 349.
VAT registration
The threshold for VAT registration is an annual turnover of over 150 million, or 37.5
million in the first 3 consecutive months.
Compulsory Registration
There are two categories of persons that are required to compulsorily register for VAT
under the VAT Act. These are:
• Persons who make taxable supplies (turnover) in excess of 37.5 million in any 3
consecutive calendar months.
• Public bodies that engage in business activities. These include Government
Ministries, departments, parastatals, Town Councils and District Administrations
among others. These bodies should apply for registration on the date they start
dealing in business activities. The business activities include hall hire, tendering
of services, markets, street parking, toilet management services, street bill board
adverts and disposal of assets, among others.

Voluntary Registration
Persons whose taxable turnover is below the VAT threshold are eligible to register if
they wish to do so provided they meet the following general requirements;
• The applicant must have a fixed place of abode or business.
• The applicant should be able to keep proper books of accounts.
• The applicant should be able to submit regular and reliable tax returns.
• The applicant should be a fit and a proper person in the opinion of the
Commissioner

IMPORTANT:
ISSUANCE OF E-INVOICES BY ALL VAT REGISTERED TAXPAYERS
It is mandatory for all VAT registered taxpayers to register for EFRIS and issue
fiscalised invoices i.e. e-invoices.
The Electronic Fiscal Receipting and Invoicing Solution (EFRIS) is a new smart
business solution used to record business transactions and share the information with
URA in real time.
An e-invoice shows that a sale has occurred through EFRIS.
Penalties for non-compliance in regard to EFRIS
A VAT registered taxpayer who does not adopt the use of EFRIS is liable to pay a
penal tax equivalent to the tax due on the goods or services or 400 currency points
whichever is higher.
Note: One currency point =20,000 Uganda Shs.

PERIOD FOR CLAIMING INPUT TAX
The law allows a period of six (6) months from the date of issue of the e-invoice within
which a person can apply for an input tax credit.
Please note: Input VAT claims are limited to only supplies acquired for use in the
related business, generating a taxable supply.


LOCAL EXCISE DUTY
This is a tax that is imposed on specified imported or locally manufactured goods,
and services. Initially Excise Duty was meant for “luxury” or prohibited items. However
excise duty is now treated as any other source of revenue for Government. The
applicable rates may be specific or ad valorem.
The tax is imposed on the value of the import; and in the case of locally manufactured
goods, the duty (local excise duty) is payable on the ex-factory price of the
manufactured goods.
Exported but locally manufactured goods are exempt from excise duty. Persons
supplying excisable goods and services are required to register and file monthly
returns to the tax authority by the 15th day of the month following the month in which
delivery of the goods was made.

Note
Excise duty is charged on deliveries (Goods and services) made out of the factory as
well as on payment regardless of whether payment is made or not.
Excise duty return is submitted on a monthly basis and the due date for both filing the
return and payment is the 15th day of the subsequent month.
Computation of excisable duty payable
EXCISE DUTY PAYABLE = (EX-FACTORY PRICE X QUANTITY) X EXCISE DUTY RATE
However, Ex-factory price is defined as;
{
  "goods_cost_breakdown": {
    "cost_of_materials": "XXXX",
    "overheads": "XXXX",
    "total_cost": "XXXXX",
    "profit": "XXXX",
    "ex_factory_price": "XXXXX"
  }
}

Example
Kanya Company limited produced and delivered 400 cartons of bottled water to a
concert. The ex-factory price per carton was 20,000 UGX and the excisable duty rate
was 10%. Required determine the excisable duty payable?
Solution
EXCISE DUTY = (EX-FACTORY PRICE X QUANTITY) X EXCISE DUTY RATE
= (400X20,000 UGX) X 10%
= UGX 800,000

DIGITAL TRACKING SOLUTION (DTS)
URA in partnership with Uganda National Bureau of Standards (UNBS) introduced
the Digital Tracking Solution (DTS) as a track & trace platform that sends production
and importation data for specific products immediately, to both URA and UNBS.
The Digital Tracking Solution involves the stamping of products with a digital stamp.
The digital stamps comprise of both;
a. Digital Tax Stamps - for tax purposes (URA) and;
b. Conformity Stamps - for safety standards certification (UNBS)
 What is a Digital Tax Stamp?
A Digital Tax Stamp is a marking that is applied to goods or their packaging and
contains; security features and codes to prevent counterfeiting of goods and enable
track and trace capabilities.
Goods affected by DTS include:
a. All excisable goods; starting with wines, spirits, water, cigarettes, beer, soda,
cement sugar, cooking oil, fruit and vegetable juices, any other alcoholic, nonalcoholic and fermented beverages.
b. Other goods as gazetted by the Commissioner.
NB. These products will not be allowed on the market without stamps.
a. The Digital Tracking Solution is used by both local manufacturers and importers
of products, specified by the Commissioner by a notice in a gazette and it is
mandatory for these taxpayers to apply tax stamps.

Benefits of DTS
a. Ability to conveniently verify and trace all specified goods throughout the
distribution chain
b. Make instant requests for report of one’s daily, weekly, monthly transactions
c. mproved record keeping since one can track their transactions
d. Facilitation to comply through immediate access of details of your production/
imports which in turn facilitates easy processing of VAT refunds and quickens
return filing
e. For importers, the system quickens customs clearing as the information would
have been captured beforehand
f) Reduction in smuggling and dumping of goods hence controlling illicit trade
and encouraging fair market competition
Penalties relating to tax stamps
A manufacturer who does not affix a stamp on gazette goods is liable to pay a penal
tax equivalent to double the tax due on goods or fifty (50) million
Shillings, whichever is higher.
