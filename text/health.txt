organisations exist under umbrella organisations; the Uganda Catholic
Medical Bureau (UCMB) and the Uganda Protestant Medical Bureau
(UPMB). The Uganda Orthodox Medical Bureau (UOMB) and the Uganda
Muslim Medical Bureau (UMMB) represent more than 5% of the health
providers.
Uganda’s health system comprises public, private-not-for-profit (PNFP) and
private-forprofit (PFP) providers as well as traditional and complementary
medicine practitioners.
The health and medical sector comprises of those who;

Key Issues
Remarks
1. IS YOUR BUSINESS OR COMPANY REGISTERED WITH URSB UGANDA
REGISTRATION SERVICES BUREAU (URSB)?
At URSB, you will receive either a Certificate of Registration (if registered
in your own names or Business Name or incorporated outside Uganda) or
Certificate of Incorporation if registered as a Limited entity. This will enable
you to register and get a Tax Identification Number (TIN) from URA, either
as an individual or Non-Individual.
2. HOW DO YOU REGISTER FOR TAXES?
A business registration certificate from URSB is a requirement before
registration for taxes with URA. Taxation in the health and medical sector
depends on your legal registration status with URSB. Once you acquire a
TIN then you must always use it when transacting with Uganda Revenue
Authority for tax purposes.


WHAT IS A TIN?
TIN stands for Tax Identification Number. It is a 10-digit number which acts
as an account of a taxpayer with Uganda Revenue Authority (URA). All
taxpayers are required to quote this number in all their communications with
URA and business transactions.
A TIN is obtained free of charge and therefore no one should charge you
for it.
The key requirements for TIN registration include;
•	 For an individual: A National ID or any two of the following
identification documents; Village ID, Employment ID, Passport, Driving
Permit, Voter’s Card, Bank Statement, Work Permit, Financial Card, Visa,
NSSF Card, etc. This is also applicable to company directors
•	 For an individual with business, a business registration certificate is
required.
•	 For a non-individual: Certificate of Incorporation/certificate of
registration, Company Form 20 showing the Directors of the company,
and any other legal documents that confirm existence.
•	 In case the directors do not have TIN’s, then their application(s) must
be submitted together with the company application form under “group
registration”.
•	 A valid email address and a mobile telephone number
•	 A referee – any person known to the applicant and has a TIN
•	 An employee shall attach proof of employment
A TIN can be acquired through any of the processes below:
1. Through the URA Web portal:
a. Visit the URA web portal
b. Download the appropriate registration form (Individual or Non
Individual),
c. Complete the form by filling in the mandatory fields (boxes)
d. Upload and submit online the completed form
e. Receive an acknowledgment notice
f. Print a copy of the form and sign it and together with the necessary
attachments submit to the nearest URA office.
g. Receive notification of approved or rejected TIN application
h. Print TIN Certificate sent to the email registered with URA from
anywhere

2. Visiting a URA designated office
In case a taxpayer cannot register online, he or she can walk into any of the
URA offices or One Stop Centre located in any Municipality or KCCA division
and assistance shall be provided to complete the registration process.
Ensure that you move along with the necessary attachments as listed above.
In case of failure to do any of the above, call the Contact Centre:
0800217000 or 0800117000 (Toll free), Whatsapp 0772140000 or send an
email to services@ura.go.ug
3. WHAT ARE THE BENEFITS OF ACQUIRING A TIN?
i. Acquiring a TIN enables you to:
	Import or export goods within and outside Uganda.
	Claim tax benefits that accrue to you e.g. tax refunds etc.
	Access bank loans.
	Acquire a trading license from Local Government / KCCA to
undertake business in their jurisdiction.
	Register your Motor Vehicle
	Process land transactions above 50 Million Shillings.

ii. TIN acts as a security measure on transactions regarding some assets
e.g. already validated motor vehicles, titled land since a notification is
automatically sent to the owner’s TIN account and registered email.


NOTE:
A local authority, government institution or regulatory body shall not
issue a license or any form of authorization necessary for purposes of
conducting any business in Uganda to any person who does not have a
Tax Identification Number including one issued by foreign tax authorities
with whom Uganda has a tax treaty or agreement for the exchange of
information.

5. WHAT TAXES ARE APPLICABLE TO THE HEALTH SECTOR?
Income Tax – Section 4 of the Income Tax Act imposes income tax for each
Year of Income on every person who has chargeable income for a given year
of income.
a) Individual Income Tax.
The income tax rate for individuals depends on the income bracket in which
the individual falls. Resident individuals enjoy a tax free annual income

threshold of UGX. 2,820,000 per annum. The balance is taxed at 10%, 20%
or 30% depending on the income bracket. Individuals who earn above UGX
120,000,000 per annum pay an additional 10% on the income above UGX
120 million.
N.B CY represents chargeable income.
{
  "Residents": {
    "0 to 2,820,000": "Nil",
    "2,820,000 to 4,020,000": "(CY – 2,820,000UGX) x 10%",
    "4,020,000 to 4,920,000": "(CY – 4,020,000UGX) x 20% + 120,000UGX",
    "4,920,000 to 120,000,000": "(CY – 4,920,000UGX) x 30% + 300,000UGX",
    "Above 120,000,000": "[(CY – 4,920,000UGX) x 30% + 300,000UGX] + [(CY – 120,000,000UGX) x 10%]"
  },
  "Non-residents": {

    "4,920,000 to 120,000,000": "(CY – 4,920,000UGX) x 30% + 582,000UGX",
    "Above 120,000,000": "[(CY – 4,920,000UGX) x 30% + 582,000UGX] + [(CY – 120,000,000UGX) x 10%]"
  }
}

 Tax payable: 68,680,000 UGX
Note that; where the business owner declares a loss, the tax payable is Nil
(Zero).

account for the allowable expenses in the generation of his gross income
from production of medicaments.


b) Non-Individual Income Tax (Corporation Tax)
This is imposed on all corporate entities (Companies) engaging in
commercial health/medical business.
Income Tax is charged at a rate of 30% on the profits from business
(Chargeable Income).

c) Pay As You Earn (PAYE)
For all entities that employ staff that are paid salaries, the firm is required to
withhold PAYE under section 19 of the income tax Act. The rates applicable
are specified under Part 1 of the 3rd Schedule of the Income Tax Act.
This is a tax deducted from the total salary of employees (earning income
above 235,000 UGX) by employers and then remitted to URA on behalf of
the employees.
If you have employees who earn income above UGX 235000/=, you are
required to withhold and remit monthly PAYE as per the PAYE rates below.
PAYE Tax rates that apply for both Residents and Non Residents.

Illustration
1. Kamude is employed at St. Mark’s Hospital and earns a monthly salary
of UGX 200,000. Is St. Mark’s hospital obliged to deduct PAYE from
Kamude’s salary?
Solution
No, because Kamude’s monthly salary is less than the threshold
(235,000) so his salary does not attract PAYE.
If Kamude’s monthly consolidated pay includes a monthly salary of 200,000,
transport allowance of UGX 75,000 and medical allowance of UGX 95,000,
the amount of Pay as You Earn to be deducted is calculated as below:
Gross Employment Income:
 UGX
Salary 200,000
Traveling allowance 75,000
Medical allowance 95,000
Total 370,000
His gross employment income lies in category three and thus we shall use
the rates in the third bracket, i.e.
Exceeding UGX 335,000 but less than UGX 410,000 (10000 + 20% of the
amount by which chargeable income exceeds UGX 335,000)
	 Chargeable income = UGX (370,000 - 335,000)...........................35,000
	 PAYE to be deducted =10,000 + 20% × 35,000.........................17,000/=


d) Withholding Tax (WHT)
Withholding tax (WHT) is income tax that is withheld at source by one
person (withholding agent) upon making payment to another person
(payee).

Withholding Agent:
A withholding agent is a person legally obliged to withhold tax on payment.
To become a withholding agent one must;
•	 Be on the list of selected / designated withholding agents published
by the Minister of finance in a gazette or
•	 Be making a payment on a transaction that is required by law to be
deducted from WHT.
Withholding tax on payments made to consultants
Hospitals and other medical facilities employ Medical consultants. They are
required to withhold 6% on the payment made to resident consultants and
15% on the payment made to non-resident consultants.
Withholding taxes may be final or creditable;
•	 Under the final withholding tax system, the amount of income tax
withheld by the withholding agent is constituted as a full and final
payment of the income tax due from the payee on the said income.
The payee is not required to file an income tax return for the particular
income that has faced final withholding tax.
•	 Under the creditable withholding tax system, taxes withheld on
certain income payments are advance tax payments which are offset
against a final tax liability in an assessment for a particular year of
income. The payee required to file an income tax return to report the
income and/or pay the difference between the tax withheld and the
tax due on the income.

WHT should be considered when making the following payments:
i. Employment income: Tax is deducted by the employer from the
employment income of every liable employee on a monthly basis under the
PAYE system.
ii. International payments: Tax is imposed on every non-resident person
who derives any dividend, interest, royalty, natural resource payment or
management charge from sources in Uganda. The tax is withheld by the
payer at the rate of 15% on the gross amount before payment.
iii. Payments to non-resident Contractors or professionals: Tax is imposed
on every non-resident person deriving income under a Ugandan source
service contract. The tax is charged at 15% of the gross amount of payment
and the person making the payment should withhold the relevant tax before
effecting the payment.

iv. Payments on dividends: A resident company which pays a dividend to a
resident shareholder is required to withhold tax at 15% of the gross amount
of the dividend paid, except where the dividend income is exempt from tax
in the hands of the shareholder. However, where the dividend is paid by a
company listed on the stock exchange to a resident shareholder, the rate is
10% on the gross amount.

Responsibility of Filing a WHT return and Payment of WHT
•	 The responsibility for payment of the tax rests primarily on the
person making payment as a withholding agent. Thus, in case of his/
her failure to withhold the tax or in case of under-withholding, the undercollected tax becomes due from the withholding agent.
•	 A WHT Agent is required to pay the tax withheld within 15 days after
the end of the month in which the payment subject to withholding tax
was made by the WHT Agent. . Note; this is not only for PAYE but also all
other Withholding taxes.


e) Rental Tax.
In cases where a person(individual or non-individual) has rental properties
and earns rental income or they lease out their land, this income is taxable
under section 5 of the Income Tax Act.


I. Value Added Tax (VAT)
It is a tax on consumption charged on value-added to “taxable” goods and
services, at different stages in the chain of distribution and is charged at a
rate of 18%. However, if the seller is registered for VAT, he can claim for his
Input tax when selling the product/service.
Note: Medical services are VAT exempt and Medical products are zero
rated.
IMPORTANT:
ISSUANCE OF E-INVOICES OR E-RECEIPTS BY ALL VAT REGISTERED
TAXPAYERS
It is mandatory for all VAT registered taxpayers to issue e-invoices or
e-receipts as no tax credit is allowed or claimable on purchases unless they
are supported by e-invoices or e-receipts.

PERIOD FOR CLAIMING INPUT TAX
The law allows a period of six (6) months from the date of issue of the
invoice within which a person can apply for an input tax credit.


6. WHAT ARE THE TAX POINTS APPLICABLE TO PLAYERS IN THE
SECTOR?
The players in this sector are expected to have the following;
	 Valid TINs that are clearly shown on invoices issued to their clients
every time they supply.
	 File income tax returns or the simplified returns under Part 1 of the
second schedule of the Income Tax Act.
	 Where their employees are earning above 235,000 UGX per month
they should withhold PAYE at the appropriate rates.
Where the company is gazetted to withhold tax on behalf of the
government, the payer is required to withhold 6% of all payments
to suppliers above UGX 1,000,000 (Section 119 (1)); these could be
transporters, cleaning firms, any other vendors. Take note that separate
supplies of goods or materials or supplies amounting to above 1 million may
attract the 6% WHT.


7. WHAT TAX INCENTIVES APPLY TO THE HEALTH AND MEDICAL

Note:
The law provides for a separate quarterly return for non-resident
suppliers of services deemed to be supplied in Uganda when made to
non-taxable persons.
A taxable person who is providing services to a non-taxable person in
Uganda and is engaged in providing services in connection to.
• Immovable property in Uganda;
• Radio or television broadcasting services received at an address in
Uganda;
• Electronic Services delivered to a person in Uganda;
• Transfer, assignment, or grant of a right to use a copyright, patent,
trademark, or similar right in Uganda;
• Telecommunication services other than those by a supplier of
telecommunication services or services to a person who is roaming
while temporarily in Uganda
These shall be required to file returns within 15 days after the end of the
three consecutive calendar months.

Advance return.
• This is a return submitted before its due date.
• During any year of income, where a taxpayer has died, is
bankrupt, wound up, gone into liquidation, is about to leave Uganda
permanently or any other reason the Commissioner considers
appropriate, he/she may be required to file an advance return by a
specified date.
• In the event that the Advance Return is not submitted by the due
date, an Advance Assessment is issued.
Note that the notice requesting for such a return shall be in writing
specifying the due date for filing the return.

Extension of the Filing Date.
• If you are not able to file a return by the due date, you can apply
for an extension to file your return providing reasons justifying the
extension.
• The extension if granted will not exceed 90 days (in aggregate)
and does not change the due date for payment of the tax due.
Interest will, therefore, accrue on any outstanding tax liability.
If any taxpayer is dissatisfied with the Commissioner’s decision about
the extension, he may challenge it under the objection and appeals
procedure.

Offenses and penalties
Failure to file a return
The penalty for failure to furnish a tax return by the due date or within a
further time allowed by the Commissioner to a fine not exceeding Shs.
1,000,000 and failure to furnish the return within the time prescribed by
court to a fine not exceeding Shs. 2,000,000 on conviction.
False Data
The penalty for knowingly or recklessly making false or misleading
statements or omitting from a statement to a tax officer, a matter
or thing is a fine not exceeding two hundred currency points that is
Shs. 4,000,000 or imprisonment not exceeding ten years or both on
conviction.


ASSESSMENTS
a. What an assessment?
An assessment is a tax form showing the estimated taxable income
generated and the tax payable on it including any penalty.

b. What is a self-assessment?
This is a form prepared by the taxpayer showing the taxable income
generated and the tax payable on it.
This is done through filing a return which may include any of the
following:
(a) An Income Tax return;
(b) A Rental income return;
(c) A VAT return;
(d) An Excise Duty return;
(e) Any other self- declaration return under the tax law.

c. What is a Default assessment?
This is a tax form showing the estimated taxable income generated and
the tax payable on it issued by the Commissioner due to failure to furnish
a self-assessment return for any given tax period.

d. What is an Advance assessment?
This is a declaration issued if the Commissioner is satisfied that there is
a risk that a taxpayer may delay, obstruct, prevent, or render ineffective
payment or collection of tax that has not yet become due.
• It may be made before the date on which the taxpayer’s tax
return for the period is due.
• It can be issued if a taxpayer defaults in submitting an advance
return when requested by the Commissioner (with or without notice).
Note that for a Default or Advance assessment, the taxpayer’s return
for the tax period shall be accepted if filed and the return shall take
precedence over the assessment.

e. What is an Additional assessment?
This is an amendment of an original tax assessment issued by the
commissioner for any tax period to ensure that correct tax liability is
obtained.
It is made at any time, if fraud or any gross or wilful neglect has been
Committed by, or on behalf of the taxpayer or new information has been
discovered in relation to the tax payable for a tax period.

f. RETURN AMENDMENT
A taxpayer may amend the tax return on condition the return is not
under investigation and amendment is done within 3 years from the date
on which the original return was lodged by the taxpayer.

g. When is the tax payment due?
• All taxpayers are required to pay the tax liable before the end of
any given tax period.
• Any unpaid tax shall be collected by the Commissioner through
serving a notice of demand on the person liable.
• The taxpayer will be given at least 28 days from the date of
service of the notice within which they can pay any outstanding
amount specified in the demand notice.

h. How the Payment made is allocated to outstanding tax?
• If a taxpayer has any outstanding liability and pays any amount,
the payment will be allocated in the order of PPI (Principal tax
liability, penal tax and Interest due).
• If a taxpayer has more than one tax liability at the time a payment
is made, the amount will be used to clear the oldest / earliest liability
first in the same order as above (PPI).

i. Can you be able to pay tax at a later date?
Yes, a taxpayer can apply in writing to the Commissioner for an extension
to pay tax at a later date.
Note that the date of payment can be extended but the payment due
date does not change and thus interest shall accrue from the due date.


OBJECTIONS AND APPEALS
i. What is an objection?
An objection is a communication from a taxpayer to the Commissioner
expressing dissatisfaction with either an assessment raised on him/her or
any other tax decision made by the Commissioner.
This is always presented in the format prescribed by the Commissioner.

ii. What are the Objection timelines?
