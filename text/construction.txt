AN OVERVIEW
Construction covers the processes involved in delivering buildings, infrastructure, industrial facilities and associated activities
through to the end of their life. It typically starts with planning, financing, and design, and continues until the asset is built and
ready for use; construction also covers repairs and maintenance work, any works to expand, extend and improve the asset, and
its eventual demolition, dismantling or decommissioning.
CONSTRUCTION INVOLVES
There are three sectors of construction: buildings, infrastructure and industrial:
•	 Building construction is divided into residential and non-residential.
•	 Infrastructure, also called heavy civil or heavy engineering, includes large public works, dams, bridges, highways, railways,
water or wastewater and utility distribution.
•	 Industrial construction includes offshore construction (mainly of energy installations), mining and quarrying, refineries,
chemical processing, power generation, mills and manufacturing plants.
Residential construction
Residential construction may be undertaken by individual land-owners (self-build), by specialist house-builders, by property
developers, by general contractors, or by providers of public or social housing (e.g.: local authorities, housing associations).
Non-residential construction
Depending upon the type of building, non-residential building construction can be procured by a wide range of private and
public organizations, including local authorities, educational and religious bodies, retailers, hoteliers, property developers,
financial institutions and other private companies.
Infrastructure construction
Civil engineering covers the design, construction, and maintenance of the physical and naturally built environment, including
public works such as roads, bridges, canals, dams, tunnels, airports, water and sewerage systems, pipelines, and railways.

Any person dealing in the construction business is required to be registered for income tax. Income tax applies generally to all
types of persons who derive income, whether an individual, non-individual or partnership.
Resident persons are taxed on worldwide income, while non-resident persons are taxed only on income derived from sources
in Uganda.
The taxpayer is required to make a self-assessment by calculating taxable income and then calculate the tax due on that
income. The taxpayer’s calculations are reviewed by revenue officials when returns are filed to ensure that the declarations
made are correct. The income tax rates apply differently to
A. Non Individuals
B. Individuals
Note: In case of a long term contract, income and deductions are taken into account on the basis of the percentage of the
contract completed during the year of income.
A) Tax rates for non-individuals in business.
The income tax rate for a company i.e. a body of persons, corporate or unincorporated, created or recognized under any law in
Uganda or elsewhere, is 30% of the entity’s CHARGEABLE INCOME (gross income less tax allowable deductions).

PAYE worked examples for resident employee.
1. Kamonde is a resident employed by ABC construction ltd. He earns a monthly salary of UGX 200,000. Is the company
obliged to deduct PAYE tax from Kamonde?
Solution; No, because Kamonde’s monthly salary is less than the threshold UGX 235,000 so his salary does not attract PAYE.
2. If Kamonde in addition to the monthly salary of UGX 200,000 is given travelling monthly allowance of UGX 95,000 and
medical monthly allowance of UGX 55,000. Monthly allowance for accommodation UGX 150,000
Compute his monthly amount of PAYE to be deducted from Kamonde’?
Solution
Computation of Monthly Employment Income:
 UGX
Salary 200,000
Travelling allowance 95,000
Medical allowance 55,000
Accommodation allowance 150,000
Total {chargeable income} 500,000
Computation of the PAYE to be deducted:
{500,000 falls under the bracket (Exceeding Shs 410,000 but not exceeding 10,000,000)}
Thus the PAYE applicable will be (30% of the amount by which chargeable income exceeds Shs 410,000 + 25000
 UGX
Chargeable Income 500,000
Less 410,000
Balance 90,000
30 % 27,000
Add 25,000
Tax there on in UGX 53,000
PAYE worked examples for non-resident employee.
3. Mr. Brown is a non-resident employed by ABC construction ltd. He earns a monthly salary of UGX15,000,000. Compute his
monthly amount of PAYE to be deducted?
Solution
15,000,000 falls under the bracket (Exceeding UGX 410,000)
Thus PAYE
= (48,500 + 30% (15,000,000 - 410,000)) + 10% (15,000,000 - 10,000,000)
= UGX 4,925,500


WITHHOLDING TAX
Withholding tax (WHT) is income tax that is withheld at source by one person (withholding agent) upon making payment to
another person (payee).

Withholding Agent
A withholding agent is a person legally obliged to withhold tax on payment.

To become a withholding agent one must;
•	 Be on the list of selected / designated withholding agents published by the Minister of finance in a gazette or
•	 Be making a payment on a transaction that is required by law to be deducted from WHT.

Withholding taxes may be final or creditable

•	 Under the final withholding tax system, the amount of income tax withheld by the withholding agent is constituted as a full
and final payment of the income tax due from the payee on the said income. The payee is not required to file an income tax
return for the particular income that has faced final withholding tax.
•	 Under the creditable withholding tax system, taxes withheld on certain income payments are advance tax payments which
are offset against a final tax liability in an assessment for a particular year of income. The payee required to file an income
tax return to report the income and/or pay the difference between the tax withheld and the tax due on the income.
WHT should be considered when making the following payments:
i. Employment income: Tax is deducted by the employer from the employment income of every liable employee on a monthly
basis under the PAYE system.
ii. International payments: Tax is imposed on every non-resident person who derives any dividend, interest, royalty, natural
resource payment or management charge from sources in Uganda. The tax is withheld by the payer at the rate of 15% on
the gross amount before payment.
iii. Payments to non-resident Contractors or professionals: Tax is imposed on every non-resident person deriving income under
a Ugandan source service contract. The tax is charged at 15% of the gross amount of payment and the person making the
payment should withhold the relevant tax before effecting the payment.
12
iv. Payments on dividends: A resident company which pays a dividend to a resident shareholder is required to withhold tax
at 15% of the gross amount of the dividend paid, except where the dividend income is exempt from tax in the hands of the
shareholder. However, where the dividend is paid by a company listed on the stock exchange to a resident shareholder, the
rate is 10% on the gross amount.
v. Payment for Goods and services: Any payment of amounts in total exceeding Shs. 1,000,000 to any person in Uganda for
the supply of goods, materials of any kind or services, is required to withhold 6% of the gross amount. The threshold of
Shs. 1,000,000 is in respect of the total contract value, implying that separate supplies which constitute one contract are
subject to the 6% withholding tax regardless of the fact that the amount paid per a single supply or transaction is less than
the threshold value.
vi. Payments to insurance agents: An insurance service provider who pays commission to an insurance agent is required to
withhold 10% of the payment.
vii. Payments to advertising agents: A person who makes a commission payment to an advertising agent is required to withhold
10% of the gross amount of the payment.
Responsibility of Filing a WHT return and Payment of WHT
•	 The responsibility for payment of the tax rests primarily on the person making payment as a withholding agent. Thus, in
case of his/her failure to withhold the tax or in case of under-withholding, the under-collected tax becomes due from the
withholding agent.
•	 A WHT Agent is required to pay the tax withheld within 15 days after the end of the month in which the payment subject to
withholding tax was made by the WHT Agent. . Note; this is not only for PAYE but also all other Withholding taxes.

Illustration
If Kato a resident individual supplies Cement worth 100 million UGX to ABC construction Ltd, he will receive a net of 94 million
UGX and the 6 million UGX (6% of 100 million UGX) will be Withheld and remitted to URA by ABC ltd on his behalf. Note that
the 6million UGX withheld forms part of Kato’s annual Tax liability and thus will reduce his Tax liability for the year.


VALUE ADDED TAX
VAT is a consumption tax charged at a rate of 18% on all supplies made by taxable persons i.e. persons registered or required
to register for VAT purposes. The threshold for VAT registration is an annual turnover of over 150 million, or 37.5 million in the
first 3 consecutive months.
Voluntary Registration
The Commissioner General shall register a person who applies for registration under Section 7 and issue to that person a
certificate of registration including the VAT registration number (TIN) unless the Commissioner General is satisfied that ;
(a) the person has no fixed place of abode or business; or
(b) the Commissioner General has reasonable grounds to believe that that person :–
•	 will not keep proper accounting records relating to any business activity carried on by that person
•	 will not submit regular and reliable tax returns as required by Section 31; or
•	 is not a fit and proper person to be registered
Some transactions are beyond the scope of VAT and these are classified as Exempt supplies. Supplies on which VAT is charged
at 0% are classified as zero-rated supplies.

NOTE:
IMPORTANT:
ISSUANCE OF E-INVOICES OR E-RECEIPTS BY ALL VAT REGISTERED TAXPAYERS
It is mandatory for all VAT registered taxpayers to issue e-invoices or e-receipts as no tax credit is allowed or claimable on
purchases unless they are supported by e-invoices or e-receipts.
All VAT registered taxpayers are obliged to register for EFRIS and issue fiscalised invoices i.e. e-invoices.
The Electronic Fiscal Receipting and Invoicing Solution (EFRIS) is a new smart business solution used to record business
transactions and share the information with URA in real time.
An e-invoice shows that a sale has occurred through EFRIS. It shows the seller’s details, URA information, Buyer’s details, Good
and services details, Tax details and Summary sections.

Penalties for non-compliance in regard to EFRIS
A VAT registered taxpayer who does not adopt the use of EFRIS is liable to pay a penal tax equivalent to the tax due on the
goods or services or 400 currency points whichever is higher.
Note: One currency point =20,000 Uganda Shs.

PERIOD FOR CLAIMING INPUT TAX
The law allows a period of six (6) months from the date of issue of the invoice within which a person can apply for an input tax
credit.


LOCAL EXCISE DUTY
This is a tax that is imposed on specified imported or locally manufactured goods, and services. Initially Excise Duty was meant
for “luxury” or prohibited items. However excise duty is now treated as any other source of revenue for Government. The
applicable rates may be specific or ad valorem.
The tax is imposed on the value of the import; and in the case of locally manufactured goods, the duty (local excise duty) is
payable on the ex-factory price of the manufactured goods.
Note
Excise duty is charged on deliveries (Goods and services) made out of the factory as well as on payment regardless of whether
payment is made or not.


CUSTOMS DUTY
These are taxes which are charged on all goods entering into or leaving our country.
The taxes charged depend on the Value and nature of the item imported.
Below are the Steps we follow when computing customs duties
•	 Step 1 Determine Customs Value (CV);
•	 Step 2 Convert the Customs Value to Local Currency (UGX);
•	 Step 3 Classify the item (HSC) as per the common external tariff;
•	 Step 4 Determine taxes collectable
•	 Step 5 Apply the duty rates on the Customs Value

Customs duties comprise of.
a) Import duty
This is a tax collected on imports and some exports not listed in the exemption schedule by URA. It is based on the customs
value of the goods that are imported. The customs value is Cost, Freight and Insurance up to Mombasa or cost and insurance
if by Air. The rate of import duty is either 0%, 10%, 25% or more for sensitive items like wheat and powdered milk.
NB. For more information on import duty rates, please refer to our common external tariff book on the portal under tax
assistant, A-Z tax topics.
Formulae for calculating import duty
	 Import Duty (ID)
= ID rate x Customs value
	 VAT
= VAT value x 18%
= (ID+EXD+CV) x 18%
Where;
ID = Import duty
EXD = Excise duty
CV = Customs value
b)
c) Excise duty at Importation
This tax is only charged on specific goods imported at varying rates.
Formulae for calculating excise duty
	 Excise duty (EXD)
= EXD value x EXD rate
= (ID + Customs value ) x EXD rate
d) VAT at importation
This is a tax on consumption charged on taxable goods imported into the country and is charged at a rate of 18% if the importer
is registered for VAT and at 15% on the 18% of the value if the importer is not registered for VAT but importing taxable goods of
a value of UGX 4,000,000 and above.
NB. If the importer is registered for VAT, he/she can claim any VAT incurred at importation through her/his monthly VAT returns.
Formulae for calculating VAT at importation
	 VAT = VAT value x 18%
= (ID+EXD+CV) x 18%
	 Domestic VAT
= 15% (VAT value x 18%)
= 15% ((ID+EXD+CV) x 18%)
e) Withholding Tax (WHT) at importation
This is income tax withheld at importation of a good. It is at a rate of 6% of customs value. It can be claimed by the importer
when he/she is filing his/her final income tax return as advanced tax already paid.
14
NB. If the importer is exempted from WHT, he/she should not be charged this tax at importation
Formulae for calculating WHT at importation
	 WHT = Customs value x 6%
f) Infrastructural levy
This levy is only applicable to dutiable items imported from outside EAC Region.
NB: The following will not attract the 1.5% Infrastructure Levy
1. Items that are at 0% Import duty rate
2. All items imported under conditional Exemptions as indicated in the 5th Schedule of the EACCMA (East African
Community Customs Management Act)
Formulae for calculating infrastructural levy
	 IL = Customs value x 1.5%
Where; IL= Infrastructural levy
g) Environmental levy
This is tax levied on imports that may be harmful to the environment for example on used clothes and used vehicle.
Formulae for calculating infrastructural levy
	EL on used clothes = Customs value x 10%
	EL on used vehicles of YOM between 5 and 10years = Customs value x 35%
EL on used vehicles of YOM 10years and above = Customs value x 50%
Where; EL= Environmental levy

ii. At any time of any year of income, where a taxpayer has died, is bankrupt, wound up, gone into liquidation, is about to
leave Uganda permanently or any other reason where the Commissioner considers appropriate that such a taxpayer may
be required to file an advance return by a specified date. Where an Advance Return is not furnished by the due date, an

Extension of Return Filing date
If a person is not able to file a return, he can apply for an extension to file his return providing reasons justifying the extension.
The extension if granted will not exceed 90 days and does not change the due date for payment of the tax due. Interest will
therefore accrue on any outstanding tax liability.
However multiple extensions can be applied for provided the number of days does not exceed 90 days.
Note: If the taxpayer is dissatisfied with the Commissioner’s decision about the extension, he may challenge it under the
objection and appeals procedure.
Offences and penalties on returns
