OVERVIEW OF THE SECTOR.
Agriculture is a dominant sector in Uganda’s economy contributing close to 23.8%
of Uganda’s Gross Domestic Product (UBOS 2015). It is the country’s main foreign
exchange earner and the largest employer of Uganda’s population with over 72% of
the population employed in this sector (UBOS, 2013). The sector currently accounts
for over 50% of the country’s exports (UBOS, 2011), but unfortunately, it only
contributes 1% of the annual revenue collections (URA, 2016).
In spite of the many people employed in the agricultural sector, it only accounts for
4% of the URA’s register; i.e. only 38,528 are currently registered for taxes, of which
96% are engaged in crop and animal production, 2% in forestry and 2% in fishing and
aquaculture.
The Agricultural sector includes the exploitation of vegetal (relating to plants) and
animal natural resources, comprising of the following activities; growing of crops,
raising and breeding of animals, harvesting of timber and other plants, animals or
animal products from a farm or their natural habitats.
According to ISIC, the three major sections of agriculture include; crop and animal
husbandry (rearing of animals and growing of crops), Forestry and logging
(cutting down trees), and Fishing and aquaculture which are practiced in two ways;
Commercial and Subsistence.
In Agriculture, there is a value chain that involves several players at the different points
in the production channel and these are involved in a wide range of activities which
include; input supply, farmer organization, farm production, post-harvest handling,
processing, provision of technologies of production and handling, grading criteria and
facilities, cooling and packing technologies, post-harvest local processing, industrial
processing, storage, and transport.
It has been observed that whereas the main players at the top of the chain are
tax compliant, for example, the players in the dairy sector who have increasingly
contributed to tax (tax growth of 57% from 14bn in 2014/15 compared to 22bn in
2015/16), the other players in the industry i.e. the farmers (milk suppliers), transporters
and others in the chain, have not complied in regard to registration for taxes.
Whereas, there is a misconception that farming is tax-exempt; this is NOT true as the
sec 35 Income Tax Act, caters for farming expenditures when computing chargeable
Income.


Generally, farming can be practiced on either a commercial or a subsistence basis.
Commercial Farming
Under commercial farming, crops are grown and animals are reared mainly for sale in
the market to generate income. i.e. for commercial purposes.
Subsistence farming
Here crops are grown mainly to meet the farmer’s family’s basic needs.
Just like any business enterprise, agriculture too has challenges that are particular to it,
some of which, include:
	 High level of informality
	 Illiteracy of the players
	 Numerous small segmented players.
	 Poor records keeping.
The sector is labor-intensive, employs a big number of casual laborers throughout
the value chain, has a very volatile market and highly fluctuating prices for products
depending on the geographical location and seasonality. For some agricultural
products, even the world prices have an effect.
Please note:
All players in the agricultural supply chain are required to register for the relevant tax
types and account for the applicable incomes. Under section 22(2)(m), of the Income
Tax Act, no expenditure will be allowed for any expense that exceeds 5 million in one
transaction in regard to supplies (goods or services) from an unregistered supplier.
The players in this sector should, therefore, endeavor to register for a TIN and also
transact with businesses that are registered.


Key Definitions in the Law:
Under the Income Tax Act Cap 340:
i. “Farming“ comprises of pastoral, agricultural, plantation, horticultural or other
similar operations
ii. “Farming income” means the business income derived from the carrying on of
farming operations.
iii. “Chargeable farming income” means the total farming income of a taxpayer for
a year of income less any deductions allowed which relate to the production of
such income that year.
iv. “Agro-processing” means a manufacturing process that substantially transforms
or converts raw agricultural produce into a different physical state and includes
the activities that take place from the point of slaughtering or harvesting the raw
product.
v. “Horticulture” includes propagation or cultivation of fungi, seeds, bulbs, spores,
or similar things; or propagation or cultivation in environments other than soil,
whether natural or artificial.
vi. “Farmworks” means any form of labor carried out on a farm and other
immovable buildings necessary for the proper operation of a farm e.g., fences,
dips, drains, water and electricity supply works, windbreaks, and other works
necessary for farming operations carried on to produce income included in gross
income but does not include farmhouses or depreciable assets.
vii. “Allowable deductions” are expenditures and losses incurred when deriving
chargeable income. The general rule is that for any expenditure to be allowed, it
must have been incurred to produce the income that has been declared as gross
income.
viii. A “withholding agent” is the person making payment and obliged to withhold tax; the recipient of the payment is the “payee”.
Note that: If a person undertaking horticulture as a business in Uganda incurs
expenditure of capital nature relating to acquisition or establishment of a plant or
construction of a greenhouse:
•	 Within the first 5 years, you will be allowed a deduction of an amount equal to
20% of expenditure in each of the years the plant or greenhouse is used in the
business of horticulture.
•	 Expenditure of a capital nature incurred on the establishment of a horticultural
plant shall include expenditure incurred in draining or clearing land.
•	 You must legalize your activities if you are dealing in commercial farming by
ensuring that your business is registered with the Uganda Revenue Authority
and a TIN is obtained.


Key Issues
 Remarks
1. IS YOUR BUSINESS OR COMPANY REGISTERED WITH URSB?
The status of your registration with the Uganda Registration Services Bureau (URSB)
as a farmer determines the tax types you will be registered for when acquiring a TIN.
At URSB, you will receive either a Certificate of Registration (if registered in your
own names or Business Name or incorporated outside Uganda) or Certificate of
Incorporation if registered as a Limited entity. This will enable you to register and get a
Tax Identification Number (TIN) from URA, either as an individual) or Non-Individual.
2 HOW DO YOU REGISTER FOR TAXES?
Taxation in the agriculture sector depends on your Legal registration status with the
Uganda Registration Services Bureau (URSB); you only apply to URA and get a TIN
if you are a commercial farmer. Once you acquire a TIN then you must always use it
when transacting with Uganda Revenue Authority for tax purposes.
Note that your business/company name must be registered by the Uganda
Registration Services Bureau (URSB).


DIRECTIVE TO MINISTRIES, GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS, AGENCIES AND
INSTITUTIONS ON USE OF TINS
Section 135(3) of the Income Tax Act (ITA), requires that every local authority,
Government institution, or regulatory body shall require a Taxpayer Identification
Number from any person applying for a license or any form of authorization
necessary for purposes of conducting any business in Uganda.
WHAT IS A TIN?
TIN stands for Tax Identification Number. It is a 10-digit number which acts as an
account of a taxpayer with Uganda Revenue Authority (URA). All taxpayers are
required to quote this number in all their communications with URA and business transactions.
A TIN is obtained free of charge and therefore no one should charge you for it.

1. WHAT TAXES ARE APPLICABLE TO THE AGRICULTURE SECTOR?
Any person dealing in commercial agriculture business is required to register for
income tax. Income tax applies generally to all types of persons who derive income,
whether an individual, non-individual or partnership.
NOTE:
•Resident persons are taxed on worldwide income, while non-resident persons are
taxed only on income derived from sources in Uganda.
•The taxpayer is required to make a self-assessment by calculating taxable income
and then calculate the tax due on that income. The taxpayer’s calculations
are reviewed by revenue officials when returns are filed to ensure that the
declarations made are correct. The income tax rates apply differently to;
a) Individuals
b) Non-individuals
a) Individual Income Tax.
The income tax rate for individuals depends on the income bracket in which the
individual falls. Resident individuals enjoy a tax free annual income threshold of UGX.
2,820,000 per annum. The balance is taxed at 10%, 20% or 30% depending on the
income bracket. Individuals who earn above UGX 120,000,000 per annum pay an
additional 10% on the income above UGX 120 million.
N.B CY represents chargeable income.

 Tax payable 68,680,000 UGX
Note: The basis for determination of Income tax liability for farmers is the gross
income generated reduced by allowable deductions.
Note that; where the commercial farmer declares a loss, the tax payable is Nil (Zero).

Illustration
1. Kamude is employed on Kibinge Farm and earns a monthly salary of UGX
200,000. Is Kibinge Farm obliged to deduct PAYE from Kamude’s salary?
Solution
No, because Kamude’s monthly salary is less than the threshold (235,000) so
his salary does not attract PAYE.
If Kamude’s monthly consolidated pay includes a monthly salary of 200,000,
transport allowance of UGX 75,000 and medical allowance of UGX 95,000, the
amount of Pay as You Earn to be deducted is calculated as below:
Gross Employment Income:
 UGX
Salary 200,000
Traveling allowance 75,000
Medical allowance 95,000
Total 370,000
His gross employment income lies in category three and thus we shall use the rates in
the third bracket, i.e.
Exceeding UGX 335,000 but less than UGX 410,000 (10000 + 20% of the amount by
which chargeable income exceeds UGX 335,000)
	Chargeable income = UGX (370,000 - 335,000).............................35,000
	PAYE to be deducted =10,000 + 20% × 35,000............................17,000/=


c) Withholding Tax (WHT)
Withholding tax (WHT) is income tax that is withheld at source by one person
(withholding agent) upon making payment to another person (payee).
Withholding Agent:
A withholding agent is a person legally obliged to withhold tax on payment.
To become a withholding agent one must;
•	 Be on the list of selected / designated withholding agents published by the
Minister of finance in a gazette or
•	 Be making a payment on a transaction that is required by law to be deducted
from WHT.
WHT should be considered when making the following payments:
•	 Employment income: Tax is deducted by the employer from the employment
income of every liable employee on a monthly basis under the PAYE system.
•	 International payments: Tax is imposed on every non-resident person who
derives any dividend, interest, royalty, natural resource payment or management
charge from sources in Uganda. The tax is withheld by the payer at the rate of
15% on the gross amount before payment.
•	 Payments to non-resident Contractors or professionals: Tax is imposed on every
non-resident person deriving income under a Ugandan source service contract.
The tax is charged at 15% of the gross amount of payment and the person
making the payment should withhold the relevant tax before effecting the
payment.
•	 Payments on dividends: A resident company which pays a dividend to a resident
shareholder is required to withhold tax at 15% of the gross amount of the
dividend paid, except where the dividend income is exempt from tax in the hands
of the shareholder. However, where the dividend is paid by a company listed
on the stock exchange to a resident shareholder, the rate is 10% on the gross
amount.
•	 Payment for Goods and services: Any payment of amounts in total exceeding
Shs. 1,000,000 to any person in Uganda for the supply of goods, materials of any
kind or services, is required to withhold 6% of the gross amount. The threshold
of Shs. 1,000,000 is in respect of the total contract value, implying that separate
supplies which constitute one contract are subject to the 6% withholding tax
regardless of the fact that the amount paid per a single supply or transaction is
less than the threshold value.
•	 Payments to insurance agents: An insurance service provider who pays
commission to an insurance agent is required to withhold 10% of the payment.
•	 Payments to advertising agents: A person who makes a commission payment
to an advertising agent is required to withhold 10% of the gross amount of the
payment.
Responsibility of Filing a WHT return and Payment of WHT
•	 The responsibility for payment of the tax rests primarily on the person making
payment as a withholding agent. Thus, in case of his/her failure to withhold the
tax or in case of under-withholding, the under-collected tax becomes due from
the withholding agent
•	 A WHT Agent is required to pay the tax withheld within 15 days after the end of
the month in which the payment subject to withholding tax was made by the
WHT Agent. . Note; this is not only for PAYE but also all other Withholding taxes.


d) Rental Tax.
In cases where a farmer has rental properties and earns rental income or they lease
out their farms or equipment, this income is taxable under section 5 of the Income Tax
Act.


I. Value Added Tax (VAT)
It is a tax on consumption charged on value-added to “taxable” goods and services, at
different stages in the chain of distribution and is charged at a rate of 18%. However, if
the seller is registered for VAT, he can claim for his Input tax when selling the product/
service.
Note
•	Farmers dealing in taxable supplies with a gross turn of over above 150
million are required to register for VAT.
•	 Farmers dealing in unprocessed items are not subject to Value Added Tax (VAT)
but must register for Income tax. However, Commercial farmers regardless of the
existence of taxable supplies are required to register for VAT to enable them to
claim for a refund of VAT on inputs used in the farm.
Voluntary Registration
The Commissioner General shall register a person who applies for registration and
issue to that person a certificate of registration including the VAT registration number
(TIN) unless the Commissioner General is satisfied that;
(a)the person has a fixed place of abode or business; or
(b)the Commissioner General has reasonable grounds to believe that that person :–
•	 will keep proper accounting records relating to any business activity carried on
by that person;
•	 will submit regular and reliable tax returns as required by Section 31; or
17
•	 is a fit and proper person to be registered
Some transactions are beyond the scope of VAT and these are classified as Exempt
supplies. Supplies on which VAT is charged at 0% are classified as zero-rated supplies.

IMPORTANT:
ISSUANCE OF E-INVOICES OR E-RECEIPTS BY ALL VAT REGISTERED TAXPAYERS
It is mandatory for all VAT registered taxpayers to issue e-invoices or e-receipts as
no tax credit is allowed or claimable on purchases unless they are supported by
e-invoices or e-receipts.
All VAT registered taxpayers are obliged to register for EFRIS and issue fiscalised
invoices i.e. e-invoices.
The Electronic Fiscal Receipting and Invoicing Solution (EFRIS) is a new smart
business solution used to record business transactions and share the information with
URA in real time.
An e-invoice shows that a sale has occurred through EFRIS. It shows the seller’s
details, URA information, Buyer’s details, Good and services details, Tax details and
Summary sections.
Penalties for non-compliance in regard to EFRIS
A VAT registered taxpayer who does not adopt the use of EFRIS is liable to pay a
penal tax equivalent to the tax due on the goods or services or 400 currency points
whichever is higher.
Note: One currency point =20,000 Uganda Shs.

PERIOD FOR CLAIMING INPUT TAX
The law allows a period of six (6) months from the date of issue of the invoice within
which a person can apply for an input tax credit.
Illustration
Bukwo Cotton Farmers sold 10 tons of cotton to Brad Ginnery at UGX 7,000,000.
Brad a cotton ginnery sold 10 tons of lint cotton to Greek Textiles at UGX 10,000,000.
Greek textiles produced bedsheets out of the cotton and sold them to Kiyembe Ltd (a
retailer) at UGX 17,500,000. Kiyembe Ltd sold all the bedsheets to various customers
and total sales were UGX 22,500,000.
Note: All figures are exclusive of VAT and the VAT rate applicable is 18%. Determine
the total VAT payable through the process.

Note that Bukwo Cotton Farmers do not have any VAT to remit to URA since they
sell raw cotton (unprocessed) to the ginnery, however, Cotton (Lint cotton) is exempt
form VAT hence Brad Grinnery has no VAT to remit to URA. VAT starts from Kiyembe
limited selling to the final consumers.
Note: If Bukwo is into commercial farming, then they would go-ahead to claim for a
refund of VAT on any inputs.
The total VAT is remitted to URA by the players in the value chain.


CUSTOMS DUTY
These are taxes which are charged on all goods entering into or leaving our country.
The taxes charged depend on the Value and nature of the item imported. Below are
the Steps we follow when computing customs duties
• Step 1 Determine Customs Value (CV);
• Step 2 Convert the Customs Value to Local Currency (UGX);
• Step 3 Classify the item (HSC) as per the common external tariff;
• Step 4 Determine taxes collectable
• Step 5 Apply the duty rates on the Customs Value
Customs duties comprise of.
a) Import duty
This is a tax collected on imports and some exports not listed in the exemption
schedule by URA. It is based on the customs value of the goods that are imported.
The customs value is Cost, Freight and Insurance up to Mombasa or cost and
insurance if by Air. The rate of import duty is either 0%, 10%, 25% or more for sensitive
items like wheat and powdered milk.
NB. For more information on import duty rates, please refer to our common external
tariff book on the portal under tax assistant, A-Z tax topics.
Formulae for calculating import duty
• Import Duty (ID) = ID rate x Customs value
• VAT = VAT value x 18%= (ID+EXD+CV) x 18%
Where;
ID= Import duty EXD= Excise duty CV= Customs value
b) Excise duty at Importation
This tax is only charged on specific goods imported at varying rates.
Formulae for calculating excise duty
• Excise duty (EXD)= EXD value x EXD rate= (ID + Customs value ) x EXD rate
c) VAT at importation
This is a tax on consumption charged on taxable goods imported into the country and
is charged at a rate of 18% if the importer is registered for VAT and at 15% on the 18%
of the value if the importer is not registered for VAT but importing taxable goods of a
value of UGX 4,000,000 and above.
NB. If the importer is registered for VAT, he/she can claim any VAT incurred at
importation through her/his monthly VAT returns.
Formulae for calculating VAT at importation
• VAT = VAT value x 18%= (ID+EXD+CV) x 18%
• Domestic VAT = 15% (VAT value x 18%) = 15% ((ID+EXD+CV) x 18%)
d) Withholding Tax (WHT) at importation
This is income tax withheld at importation of a good. It is at a rate of 6% of customs
value. It can be claimed by the importer when he/she is filing his/her final income tax
return as advanced tax already paid.
NB. If the importer is exempted from WHT, he/she should not be charged this tax at
importation
Formulae for calculating WHT at importation
• WHT = Customs value x 6%
e) Infrastructural levy
This levy is only applicable to dutiable items imported from outside EAC Region.
NB: The following will not attract the 1.5% Infrastructure Levy
1. Items that are at 0% Import duty rate
2. All items imported under conditional Exemptions as indicated in the 5th
Schedule of the EACCMA (East African Community Customs Management
Act)
Formulae for calculating infrastructural levy
• IL = Customs value x 1.5%
Where; IL= Infrastructural levy
f) Environmental levy
This is tax levied on imports that may be harmful to the environment for example on
used clothes and used vehicle.
Formulae for calculating infrastructural levy
• EL on used clothes = Customs value x 10%
• EL on used vehicles of YOM between 5 and 10years = Customs value x 35%
EL on used vehicles of YOM 10years and above = Customs value x 50% Where;
EL= Environmental levy


TREATMENT OF CHARGES IMPOSED BY LOCAL AUTHORITIES UNDER INCOME
TAX.
HOW ARE THE LOCAL AUTHORITY CHARGES TREATED FOR INCOME TAX
PURPOSES?
All charges imposed by local authorities (ground rent, environmental tax, and license
operating fees) are allowed as a deduction in the income statement.


WHAT ARE THE TAX POINTS APPLICABLE TO PLAYERS IN THE SECTOR?
i. The suppliers of raw materials: These are expected to have the following;
 Valid TINs that are clearly shown on invoices issued to their clients every time they
supply.

schedule of the Income Tax Act.
 They may opt to use presumptive rates where applicable
 Farmers who into Commercial Farming are required to register for VAT
 Where their employees are earning above 235,000 UGX per month they should
withhold PAYE at the appropriate rates.
ii. Other suppliers: These could either be local suppliers or foreign suppliers.
o Local suppliers: where the company is gazetted to withhold tax on behalf of the
government, the payer is required to withhold 6% of all payments to suppliers
above UGX 1,000,000 (Section 119 (1)); these could be transporters, cleaning
firms, any other vendors. Take note that separate supplies of goods or materials or
supplies amounting to above 1 million may attract the 6% WHT.
o International payments: this is applicable where a farmer makes foreign payments
for management fees or makes payments to non-resident contractors or
professionals under section 83 and 85 of the Income Tax Act respectively.

Advance return
• This is a return submitted before its due date.

Advance Assessment is issued.
Note that the notice requesting for such a return shall be in writing specifying the due
date for filing the return.
Extension of the Filing Date
• If you are not able to file a return by the due date, you can apply for an
extension to file your return providing reasons justifying the extension.
• The extension if granted will not exceed 90 days (in aggregate) and does not
change the due date for payment of the tax due. Interest will, therefore, accrue
on any outstanding tax liability.

Advance assessment
Is a declaration issued if the Commissioner is satisfied that there is a risk that a
taxpayer may delay, obstruct, prevent, or render ineffective payment or collection of
tax that has not yet become due.
It may be made before the date on which the taxpayer’s tax return for the period is
due.
It can be issued if a taxpayer defaults in submitting an advance return when requested
by the Commissioner. However the Commissioner can also issue this assessment
without notice. This assessment can be objected to and can also be amended.
Where the taxpayer files a returns for a given period on which a Default or Advance
assessments was issued, the taxpayer’s return for that period shall be accepted and
takes precedence over the default assessment.
Taxpayer is allowed to submit his/her return together with the objection.
Additional assessment

any tax period to ensure that correct tax liability is obtained.
It is made at any time where fraud or any gross or wilful neglect has been committed
by, or on behalf of the taxpayer or new information has been discovered in relation to
the tax payable for a tax period.

and shall declare its findings not later than 60 days from the date of filing the
appeal.
• An appeal to the Supreme Court may be lodged with a certificate of the
court of appeal that the matter raises questions of law of great public
importance or if the Supreme Court in its overall duty to see that justice is
done, considers that the appeal should be heard.

and ending on the last day of the month in which the refund is made.
Reviewing body means the Tribunal, the High Court, the Court of Appeal and
the Supreme Court.


ENFORCEMENT OF TAX
i. How is a tax collected from persons leaving Uganda permanently?
The Commissioner may issue a certificate containing particulars of the tax payable to
the ofcer responsible for immigration control and request the Commissioner for
Immigration to prevent that person from leaving Uganda until that person;
(a) Makes payment of the tax in full; or
(b) Executes a financial bond guaranteeing payment of the tax liability.

ii. What are the tax Recovery procedures?
When a person refuses or fails to comply, the taxes may be collected using various
methods, such as:
• By Distress i.e. selling goods on which the assessed person has a claim in
order to recover the tax.
• By Agency Notice: i.e. instructing a person who has money or other liabilities
of the assessed person to pay the held amount directly to URA.
• Temporary closure of business premises.
• Charge over immovable property: The Commissioner may write, to the
Registrar of Titles, and direct the Registrar that the land or buildings in the
notice are the subjects of security for unpaid tax.
• Seizure of goods in cases where there is proof that the taxes due have not
been paid especially in respect of the supply, removal or import of the goods.
Note: The Commissioner may write to a taxpayer, to give security by bond, deposit, or
