TAX TYPES APPLICABLE TO THE EDUCATION AND SPORTS SECTOR
INCOME TAX
Any person dealing in education services business is required to be registered for
income tax. Income tax applies generally to all types of persons who derive income,
whether an individual, non-individual or partnership.
Resident persons are taxed on worldwide income, while non-resident persons are taxed
only on income derived from sources in Uganda.
The tax payer is required to make a self-assessment by calculating the taxable income
and then calculate tax due on that income. The taxpayer’s calculations are reviewed
by revenue officials when returns are filed to ensure that the declarations made are
correct. The income tax rates apply differently to;
A.Non Individuals
B.Individuals
A) Tax rates for non-individuals in education services business.
The income tax rate for a company i.e. a body of persons, corporate or unincorporated,
created or recognized under any law in Uganda or elsewhere, is 30% of the entity’s
CHARGEABLE INCOME (gross income less tax allowable deductions.)

[(CY – 4,920,000) x 30% + 300,000] + [(CY –120,000,000) x 10%]
{(138,892,000-4,920,000) *30%+300,000} + {(138,892,000-120,000,000) *10%}
=42,380,800

{500,000 falls under the bracket (Exceeding Shs. 410,000 but not exceeding
10,000,000)}
Thus the PAYE applicable will be (30% of the amount by which chargeable income
exceeds Shs. 410,000 + 25000
Chargeable Income 500.000 UGX
Less 410.000 UGX
Balance 90,000 UGX
30 % 27,000 UGX
Add 25,000 UGX
Tax there on in UGX 53,000
PAYE worked examples for non-resident employee.
3. Mr. Brown is a non-resident employed by Seeta primary school. He earns a monthly
salary of UGX15, 000,000. Compute his monthly amount of PAYE to be deducted?
Solution
15,000,000 falls under the bracket (Exceeding UGX 410,000)
Thus PAYE = (48,500 + 30% (15,000,000 - 410,000)) + 10% (15,000,000 - 10,000,000)
= UGX 4,925,500

Common Mistakes made under PAYE Returns
1. Excluding:
• Temporary staff

• Technical staff
• Contract staff
2. Not showing:
• Staff TINS
• Allowances for permanent and contract staff
3. Others

WITHHOLDING TAX (WHT)
Withholding tax (WHT) is income tax that is withheld at source by one person
(withholding agent) upon making payment to another person (payee).
Withholding Agent:
A withholding agent is a person legally obliged to withhold tax on payment.
To become a withholding agent one must;
• Be on the list of selected / designated withholding agents published by the Minister
of finance in a gazette or
• Be making a payment on a transaction that is required by law to be deducted from
WHT.
Withholding taxes may be final or creditable;
• Under the final withholding tax system, the amount of income tax withheld by the
withholding agent is constituted as a full and final payment of the income tax due
from the payee on the said income. The payee is not required to file an income tax
return for the particular income that has faced final withholding tax.
• Under the creditable withholding tax system, taxes withheld on certain income
payments are advance tax payments which are offset against a final tax liability in
an assessment for a particular year of income. The payee required to file an income
tax return to report the income and/or pay the difference between the tax withheld
and the tax due on the income.
WHT should be considered when making the following payments:
i. Employment income: Tax is deducted by the employer from the employment
income of every liable employee on a monthly basis under the PAYE system.
ii. International payments: Tax is imposed on every non-resident person who derives
16 A GUIDE TO TAXATION OF THE EDUCATION SECTOR
any dividend, interest, royalty, natural resource payment or management charge
from sources in Uganda. The tax is withheld by the payer at the rate of 15% on the
gross amount before payment.
iii. Payments to non-resident Contractors or professionals: Tax is imposed on every
non-resident person deriving income under a Ugandan source service contract. The
tax is charged at 15% of the gross amount of payment and the person making the
payment should withhold the relevant tax before effecting the payment.
iv. Payments on dividends: A resident company which pays a dividend to a resident
shareholder is required to withhold tax at 15% of the gross amount of the dividend
paid, except where the dividend income is exempt from tax in the hands of the
shareholder. However, where the dividend is paid by a company listed on the stock
exchange to a resident shareholder, the rate is 10% on the gross amount.
v. Payment for Goods and services: Any payment of amounts in total exceeding Shs.
1,000,000 to any person in Uganda for the supply of goods, materials of any kind
or services, is required to withhold 6% of the gross amount. The threshold of Shs.
1,000,000 is in respect of the total contract value, implying that separate supplies
which constitute one contract are subject to the 6% withholding tax regardless of
the fact that the amount paid per a single supply or transaction is less than the
threshold value.
vi. Payments to insurance agents: An insurance service provider who pays commission
to an insurance agent is required to withhold 10% of the payment.
vii. Payments to advertising agents: A person who makes a commission payment to an
advertising agent is required to withhold 10% of the gross amount of the payment.
Responsibility of Filing a WHT return and Payment of WHT
• The responsibility for payment of the tax rests primarily on the person making
payment as a withholding agent. Thus, in case of his/her failure to withhold the
tax or in case of under-withholding, the under-collected tax becomes due from the
withholding agent.
• A WHT Agent is required to pay the tax withheld within 15 days after the end of
the month in which the payment subject to withholding tax was made by the WHT
Agent. . Note; this is not only for PAYE but also all other Withholding taxes.


VALUE ADDED TAX (VAT)
VAT is an indirect tax on consumption charged on value added to taxable supplies at
different stages in the chain of distribution.
Taxable supplies are goods or services supplied by a taxable person i.e. persons
registered or required to register for VAT purposes.
Taxable supplies are not exempt and can either be; Standard rated at 18% VAT or Zerorated at 0% VAT
 The threshold for VAT registration is an annual turnover of taxable supplies of Shs.150
million, or Shs. 37.5 million in the first 3 consecutive months.
A GUIDE TO TAXATION OF THE EDUCATION SECTOR 17
VAT exempt supplies
EDUCATION SERVICES ARE VAT EXEMPT SUPPLIES
 This means schools cannot charge VAT.
“Education services” means;
• a pre-primary, primary, secondary school,
• a technical college or university
• an institution established for the promotion of adult education, vocational training,
technical education, or the education or training of physically or mentally handicapped
persons;
VAT zero rated supplies
The supply of educational materials.

IMPORTANT
ISSUANCE OF E-INVOICES OR E-RECEIPTS BY ALL VAT REGISTERED TAXPAYERS
It is mandatory for all VAT registered taxpayers to issue e-invoices or e-receipts as no
tax credit is allowed or claimable on purchases unless they are supported by e-invoices
or e-receipts.
All VAT registered taxpayers are obliged to register for EFRIS and issue fiscalised
invoices i.e. e-invoices.
The Electronic Fiscal Receipting and Invoicing Solution (EFRIS) is a new smart business
solution used to record business transactions and share the information with URA in
real time.
An e-invoice shows that a sale has occurred through EFRIS. It shows the seller’s details,
URA information, Buyer’s details, Good and services details, Tax details and Summary
sections.
Penalties for non-compliance in regard to EFRIS
A VAT registered taxpayer who does not adopt the use of EFRIS is liable to pay a
penal tax equivalent to the tax due on the goods or services or 400 currency points
whichever is higher.
Note: One currency point =20,000 Uganda Shs.


PERIOD FOR CLAIMING INPUT TAX
The law allows a period of six (6) months from the date of issue of the invoice within
which a person can apply for an input tax credit.
Rental Tax.
In cases where a person in education business, has rental properties and earns rental
income or they lease out their land, this income is taxable under section 5 of the Income
Tax Act.
CUSTOMS DUTY
These are taxes which are charged on all goods entering into or leaving our country.
18 A GUIDE TO TAXATION OF THE EDUCATION SECTOR
The taxes charged depend on the Value and nature of the item imported.
Below are the Steps we follow when computing customs duties
• Step 1 Determine Customs Value (CV);
• Step 2 Convert the Customs Value to Local Currency (UGX);
• Step 3 Classify the item (HSC) as per the common external tariff;
• Step 4 Determine taxes collectable
• Step 5 Apply the duty rates on the Customs Value
Customs duties comprise of.
a) Import duty
This is a tax collected on imports and some exports not listed in the exemption schedule
by URA. It is based on the customs value of the goods that are imported. The customs
value is Cost, Freight and Insurance up to Mombasa or cost and insurance if by Air. The
rate of import duty is either 0%, 10%, 25% or more for sensitive items like wheat and
powdered milk.
NB. For more information on import duty rates, please refer to our common external
tariff book on the portal under tax assistant, A-Z tax topics.
Formulae for calculating import duty
	Import Duty (ID) = ID rate x Customs value
	VAT = VAT value x 18%= (ID+EXD+CV) x 18%
Where;
ID= Import duty
EXD= Excise duty
CV= Customs value
b)Excise duty at Importation
This tax is only charged on specific goods imported at varying rates.
Formulae for calculating excise duty
	Excise duty (EXD)= EXD value x EXD rate= (ID + Customs value ) x EXD rate
c) VAT at importation
This is a tax on consumption charged on taxable goods imported into the country and
is charged at a rate of 18% if the importer is registered for VAT and at 15% on the 18%
of the value if the importer is not registered for VAT but importing taxable goods of a
value of UGX 4,000,000 and above.
NB. If the importer is registered for VAT, he/she can claim any VAT incurred at
importation through her/his monthly VAT returns.
A GUIDE TO TAXATION OF THE EDUCATION SECTOR 19
Formulae for calculating VAT at importation
	 VAT = VAT value x 18%= (ID+EXD+CV) x 18%
	Domestic VAT = 15% (VAT value x 18%) = 15% ((ID+EXD+CV) x 18%)
d)Withholding Tax (WHT) at importation
This is income tax withheld at importation of a good. It is at a rate of 6% of customs
value. It can be claimed by the importer when he/she is filing his/her final income tax
return as advanced tax already paid.
NB. If the importer is exempted from WHT, he/she should not be charged this tax at
importation
Formulae for calculating WHT at importation
	WHT = Customs value x 6%
e) Infrastructural levy
This levy is only applicable to dutiable items imported from outside EAC Region.
NB: The following will not attract the 1.5% Infrastructure Levy
1. Items that are at 0% Import duty rate
2. All items imported under conditional Exemptions as indicated in the 5th Schedule of
the EACCMA (East African Community Customs Management Act)
Formulae for calculating infrastructural levy
	IL = Customs value x 1.5%
Where; IL= Infrastructural levy
f) Environmental levy
This is tax levied on imports that may be harmful to the environment for example on
used clothes and used vehicle.
Formulae for calculating infrastructural levy
	EL on used clothes = Customs value x 10%
	EL on used vehicles of YOM between 5 and 10years = Customs value x 35%
EL on used vehicles of YOM 10years and above = Customs value x 50%
Where; EL= Environmental levy

ii. At any time of any year of income, where a taxpayer has died, is bankrupt, wound
up, gone into liquidation, is about to leave Uganda permanently or any other
reason where the Commissioner considers appropriate that such a taxpayer may
be required to file an advance return by a specified date.

the return.
Extension of Return Filing date
If a person is not able to file a return, he can apply for an extension to file his return
