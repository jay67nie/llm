PAYE worked examples for resident employee.
1. Kamonde is a resident employed by Mwana Hotel. He earns a monthly salary of
UGX. 200,000. Is
Mwana hotel obliged to deduct PAYE tax from Kamonde?
Solution; No, because Kamonde’s monthly salary is less than the threshold UGX
235,000 so his salary does not attract PAYE.
2. If Kamonde in addition to the monthly salary of UGX 200,000 is given travelling
allowance of UGX 75,000 and medical allowance of UGX 45,000.
Compute his monthly amount of PAYE to be deducted?
Solution; Employment Income:
Taxation Of The Hotel And Accommodation 13
Salary 200,000 UGX
Travelling allowance 75,000 UGX
Medical allowance 45,000 UGX
Total 320,000 UGX {chargeable income}
UGX 320,000 falls under the bracket (Exceeding UGX 235,000 but not exceeding
UGX 335,000)
Thus the PAYE applicable will be (10% of the amount by which chargeable income
exceeds UGX 235,000)
Chargeable income = 10 %( 320,000 - 235,000) =8,500 UGX

PAYE worked examples for non-resident employee.
3. Mr. Brown is a non-resident employed by Crested Crane Hotel. He earns a monthly
salary of Shs 15,000,000. Compute his monthly amount of PAYE to be deducted?
Solution
15,000,000 falls under the bracket (Exceeding UGX. 410,000)
Thus PAYE = (48,500 + 30% (15,000,000 - 410,000)) + 10 % (15,000,000 -
10,000,000) = UGX. 4,925,500


WITHHOLDING TAX
Withholding tax (WHT) is a form of advance income tax that is withheld at source by
one person (withholding agent) upon making payment to another person (payee).
The supplier receives a Tax Credit Certificate that helps in offsetting tax liability in the
final income tax return.

Who is a Withholding Agent?
A withholding agent is a person legally obliged to withhold tax on payment. To
become a withholding agent one must;
• Be on the list of selected / designated withholding agents published by the
Minister of finance in a gazette or
• Be making a payment on a transaction that is required by law to be deducted from
WHT.
Responsibility of Filing a WHT return and Payment of WHT
• The responsibility for payment of the tax rests primarily on the person making
payment as a withholding agent. Thus, in case of his/her failure to withhold the tax
or in case of under-withholding, the under-collected tax becomes due from the
withholding agent.
• A WHT Agent is required to pay the tax withheld within 15 days after the end of
the month in which the payment subject to withholding tax was made by the
WHT Agent. . Note; this is not only for PAYE but also all other Withholding taxes.
WHT should be considered when making the following payments:
i. International payments: Tax is imposed on every non-resident person who
14 Taxation Of The Hotel And Accommodation
derives any dividend, interest, royalty, natural resource payment or management
charge from sources in Uganda. The tax is withheld by the payer at the rate of
15% on the gross amount before payment.
ii. Payments to non-resident Contractors or professionals: Tax is imposed on every
non-resident person deriving income under a Ugandan source service contract.
The tax is charged at 15% of the gross amount of payment and the person
making the payment should withhold the relevant tax before effecting the
payment.
iii. Payments on dividends: A resident company which pays a dividend to a resident
shareholder is required to withhold tax at 15% of the gross amount of the
dividend paid, except where the dividend income is exempt from tax in the hands
of the shareholder. However, where the dividend is paid by a company listed
on the stock exchange to a resident shareholder, the rate is 10% on the gross
amount.
iv. Payment for Goods and services: Any payment of amounts in total exceeding
Shs. 1,000,000 to any person in Uganda for the supply of goods, materials of any
kind or services, is required to withhold 6% of the gross amount. The threshold
of Shs. 1,000,000 is in respect of the total contract value, implying that separate
supplies which constitute one contract are subject to the 6% withholding tax
regardless of the fact that the amount paid per a single supply

Illustration
If Kato a resident individual supplies hotel sundries worth 100M UGX to XYZ hotel
(Designated withholding agent), he will receive a net of 94 million UGX and the 6
million UGX (6% of 100M UGX) will be Withheld and remitted to URA by XYZ hotel on
his behalf. Note that the 6million UGX withheld forms part of Kato’s annual Tax liability
and thus will reduce his Tax liability for the year.


VALUE ADDED TAX (VAT)
This is an indirect tax on consumption charged on value added to taxable supplies, at
different stages in the chain of distribution at the rate of 18%.
Some transactions are beyond the scope of VAT and these are classified as exempt
supplies and are specified in the Second Schedule of the VAT Act Cap 349. Supplies
on which VAT is charged at 0% are classified as zero-rated supplies and are specified
in the Third Schedule of the VAT Act Cap 349.

VAT registration
The threshold for VAT registration is an annual turnover of over 150 million, or 37.5
million in the first 3 consecutive months.

Compulsory Registration
There are two categories of persons that are required to compulsorily register for VAT
under the VAT Act. These are:
• Persons who make taxable supplies (turnover) in excess of 37.5 million in any 3
consecutive calendar months.
• Public bodies that engage in business activities. These include Government
Taxation Of The Hotel And Accommodation 15
Ministries, departments, parastatals, Town Councils and District Administrations
among others. These bodies should apply for registration on the date they start
dealing in business activities. The business activities include hall hire, tendering
of services, markets, street parking, toilet management services, street bill board
adverts and disposal of assets, among others.

Voluntary Registration
Persons whose taxable turnover is below the VAT threshold are eligible to register if
they wish to do so provided they meet the following general requirements;
• The applicant must have a fixed place of abode or business.
• The applicant should be able to keep proper books of accounts.
• The applicant should be able to submit regular and reliable tax returns.
• The applicant should be a fit and a proper person in the opinion of the Commissioner

IMPORTANT
ISSUANCE OF E-INVOICES OR E-RECEIPTS BY ALL VAT REGISTERED
TAXPAYERS
It is mandatory for all VAT registered taxpayers to register for EFRIS and issue
fiscalised invoices i.e. e-invoices.
The Electronic Fiscal Receipting and Invoicing Solution (EFRIS) is a new smart
business solution used to record business transactions and share the information with
URA in real time.
An e-invoice shows that a sale has occurred through EFRIS.
Penalties for non-compliance in regard to EFRIS
A VAT registered taxpayer who does not adopt the use of EFRIS is liable to pay a
penal tax equivalent to the tax due on the goods or services or 400 currency points
whichever is higher.
Note: One currency point =20,000 Uganda Shs.

PERIOD FOR CLAIMING INPUT TAX
The law allows a period of six (6) months from the date of issue of the e-invoice within
which a person can apply for an input tax credit.
Please note: Input VAT claims are limited to only supplies acquired for use in the
related business, generating a taxable supply.

tourist/client if sent back, should include all the VAT not utilized. However, the VAT

TREATMENT OF LOCAL HOTEL TAX UNDER INCOME TAX.
WHAT IS LOCAL HOTEL TAX (LHT)?
This is a tax levied and paid by room occupants of Hotel and lodges.
HOW IS LOCAL HOTEL TAX LEVIED?
LHT is levied on hotel and room accommodation per room per night and is paid by
the room occupant.
WHO THEN SUBMITS THE TAX TO KCCA/MUNICIPAL OR TOWN COUNCIL?
The tax is collected by the management of the hotel, which remits the same to
KCCA/ Municipal or Town Council on a monthly basis.
HOW IS THIS LOCAL HOTEL TAX TREATED FOR INCOME TAX PURPOSES?
Local Service Tax is not paid by the hotel owner but it’s paid by the guests
who occupy the room. It is thus not revenue to the hotel owner. For income tax
purposes this is not allowed as an expense to the hotel owner as this revenue is not
recognized in the records of the hotel owner and should thus be paid to the local
authorities as and when received by the hotel management.

extension, he may challenge it under the objection and appeals procedure.
